#### Project 2: How Can We Lower Hospital Readmission Rates?
Hospitals are financially penalized for having high rates of readmissions (patients returning to the hospital within 30 days of a prior admission). I used linear regression to predict hospital readmission rates using geographical and other hospital-specific features. Understanding the signficant features associated with a high number of readmissions can inform specific strategies for readmission reduction.

#### Project 3: Improving Medical Appointment Attendance
Preventing missed medical appointments ensures patients receive timely care and allows clinics to remain open. In this project, I used a classification method (XGBoost) to classify appointments as shows/no-shows based on patient information and past appointment attendance history. I also built a calculator to calculate potential cost savings for the clinic of increasing medical appointment attendance.

#### Project 4: Skincare Recommendations for Busy People
The online community of skincare enthusiasts is large and vocal, but many people want to find skincare products without parsing through all of the chatter. I created a recommendation system by using NLP on Amazon skincare product reviews and LDA topic modeling to identify common themes among reviews. Using cosine similarity and sentiment analysis, I created a recommendation system that recommended products in a single product category, different categories (to complement a skincare routine), and also used LDA-generated topics to generate recommendations for specific concerns (e.g. sensitive skin, acne control, and anti-aging).

#### Project 5: Day-Ahead Solar Energy Forecasting
Day-ahead predictions of solar panel energy output can help power companies plan ahead. Using the time series forecasting method SARIMAX, I forecasted hourly output predictions using historical panel output data from a solar grid in Fresno, CA as well as solar irradiance data for the same location. I also built a Tableau dashboard to allow users to visualize and interact with forecasted and historical data.
