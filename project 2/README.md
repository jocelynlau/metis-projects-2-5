#### [Project 2: How Can We Lower Hospital Readmission Rates?](https://github.com/jocelynlau/metis-projects-2-5/tree/master/project%202)
Hospitals are financially penalized for having high rates of readmissions (patients returning to the hospital within 30 days of a prior admission). I used linear regression to predict hospital readmission rates using geographical and other hospital-specific features. Understanding the signficant features associated with a high number of readmissions can inform specific strategies for readmission reduction.<br>
