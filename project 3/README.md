# Metis Project 3
### Metis Data Science Bootcamp Fall 2019 Cohort

#### [Project 3: Improving Medical Appointment Attendance](https://github.com/jocelynlau/metis-projects-2-5/tree/master/project%203)
Preventing missed medical appointments ensures patients receive timely care and allows clinics to remain open. In this project, I used a classification method (XGBoost) to classify appointments as shows/no-shows based on patient information and past appointment attendance history. I also built a calculator to calculate potential cost savings for the clinic of increasing medical appointment attendance.<br>
