I have moderate rosacea that sometimes becomes severely inflamed across my cheeks, nose, and above my nose. Some products would give me relief from symptoms for a week or so, and then stop working. I tried creams, natural and vitamin supplements, mineral creams, yoga, everything I remotely thought might help. This product is the only thing that has EVER worked, and it works quickly (drastically reduces redness within an hour usually- two hours at my worst inflammation), leaves no greasiness, and doesn't mess with my allergies. It is the most expensive beauty product I've ever bought, so it was risky, but I was desperate. I applied sparingly, maybe two or three times a week only to my cheeks, entire nose, and small area on forehead, and the jar lasted me one year exactly. I use fragrance/dye free generic moisturizer for my daily regimen, but this product is so effective I never needed to use it daily. If I could afford it, I would use it twice a day as my regular moisturizer. It leaves my skin smooth, velvety (instead of oily or dry) and free of the redness and bumps. It also dimished my acne outbreaks, which I think were associated with the rosacea, and the fine lines I was beginning to get due to the constant dryness. I love it so much that I told my dermatologist about it so that he could recommend it. Now I'm looking for a DERMAdoctor product for the severe eczema I have on the rest on my body.\",\n",

For a gal who cringes at $35 for Clinique moisturizer, that's a lot of dough. But this was by far the best money I ever spent on my skin! I have self-diagnosed mild rosacea and didn't want the usual treatment of oral antibiotics (which have their own set of problems for me). With just a few dabs of this product twice daily on my nose, cheeks and chin, I'm virtually redness-free, and my occasional blemishes are reduced by about half.\\n\\nCC&C isn't miraculous. On infrequent occasions, I remain blotchy despite using it. This is usually when I've been under a lot of stress or have been sick. Extrapolating from that experience, I believe the greater the severity of the rosacea, the more limited CC&C's results will be.\\n\\nCC&C doubles as a regular moisturizer, so - unless you have extremely dry skin - there's no need to use another moisturizer over it. I wear it at night, and beneath makeup during the day, applying it only in my redness-prone areas. I save a few bucks by using my less expensive moisturizers on the rest of my face and neck. At this rate, one $85 jar lasts me about 5 months. Not too bad, when I think of it as $17 per month.\",\n",

I've used this product about two weeks so far and I have to say, my skins not perfect but its getting there!! Its the closest to perfect it has been since I was about 14 (I'm 22.) I have a lot of cystic acne problems and had read somewhere this was good for hormonal and cystic breakouts. (I'm not saying that is true since I am not a scientist but my face has improved so I wouldn't be surprised if the claim is legit.) Within a week my face improved a lot and for me thats just an incredible thing.\\n\\nJust a side note I used a trio of products not this alone! I think that is important to say.

I do wish this product was more affordable....in this economy I have to struggle to pay the bills -versus- treating my unwanted (and unsightly, in my own opinion)skin conditions to make myself feel better.

What has made it more difficult for me to use products is that I have dry skin.  Products made to treat the acne portion of my Rosacea increase the dryness and redness.  Using a moisterizer or product to reduce the redness makes the acne worse. So I tried this. Not expecting much. And I can't believe it.  It immediately reduced the dryness and redness.  The inflammation improved. And the Acne? Started to heal. Really. I'm not kidding.  This stuff actually works.  As for the many reviewers comments about the price being high.  Think of it this way.  How expensive has it been going to doctors, paying for prescriptions or trying over the counter products you end up throwing out after 3 days?

As I said above, the product is very good but here is the problem: The last time I received this, the jar was tiny! What use to last 3 months won't even last a month now. I have been using CCC for 7+ years. This last tiny jar had big air bubbles in it. I tried to write this on their site and they wouldn't post it. This makes me think they are only posting the reviews that give CCC a good rating.\",\n",

I tried CC&C on top of my rx with wonderful results; when I use it consistently it makes an enormous change in reducing the redness and clearing up the dry patches. I have been using this product for the last two years. Since then I have completely stopped having the \"mini acne\" that is part of this condition.  This product is now my #1 self-care must have--worth every penny.\\n\\nI looked at my order history for the period I have been using CC&C and I re-order it about every 3-4 months, so I budget about $25 a month for it.',\n",
