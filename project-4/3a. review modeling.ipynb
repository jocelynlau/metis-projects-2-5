I have moderate rosacea that sometimes becomes severely inflamed across my cheeks, nose, and above my nose. Some products would give me relief from symptoms for a week or so, and then stop working. I tried creams, natural and vitamin supplements, mineral creams, yoga, everything I remotely thought might help. This product is the only thing that has EVER worked, and it works quickly (drastically reduces redness within an hour usually- two hours at my worst inflammation), leaves no greasiness, and doesn't mess with my allergies. It is the most expensive beauty product I've ever bought, so it was risky, but I was desperate. I applied sparingly, maybe two or three times a week only to my cheeks, entire nose, and small area on forehead, and the jar lasted me one year exactly. I use fragrance/dye free generic moisturizer for my daily regimen, but this product is so effective I never needed to use it daily. If I could afford it, I would use it twice a day as my regular moisturizer. It leaves my skin smooth, velvety (instead of oily or dry) and free of the redness and bumps. It also dimished my acne outbreaks, which I think were associated with the rosacea, and the fine lines I was beginning to get due to the constant dryness. I love it so much that I told my dermatologist about it so that he could recommend it. Now I'm looking for a DERMAdoctor product for the severe eczema I have on the rest on my body.\",\n",

I have found that Noredol is slightly cheaper and it is gel based so it goes a lot further and appears to be working just as well but not quite as moisturizing.

For a gal who cringes at $35 for Clinique moisturizer, that's a lot of dough. But this was by far the best money I ever spent on my skin! I have self-diagnosed mild rosacea and didn't want the usual treatment of oral antibiotics (which have their own set of problems for me). With just a few dabs of this product twice daily on my nose, cheeks and chin, I'm virtually redness-free, and my occasional blemishes are reduced by about half.\\n\\nCC&C isn't miraculous. On infrequent occasions, I remain blotchy despite using it. This is usually when I've been under a lot of stress or have been sick. Extrapolating from that experience, I believe the greater the severity of the rosacea, the more limited CC&C's results will be.\\n\\nCC&C doubles as a regular moisturizer, so - unless you have extremely dry skin - there's no need to use another moisturizer over it. I wear it at night, and beneath makeup during the day, applying it only in my redness-prone areas. I save a few bucks by using my less expensive moisturizers on the rest of my face and neck. At this rate, one $85 jar lasts me about 5 months. Not too bad, when I think of it as $17 per month.\",\n",

I have rosacea and peri-oral dermatitis with severe peeling and redness.  This product was very soothing and definitely helped the redness.  It also did not cause any acne breakouts.  I was disappointed, however, in the moisturizing effect of this product.  It isn't very hydrating and didn't help the severe peeling in my T-zone. If the product helped the dryness and peeling along with it's positive effect on the redness, I would probably try another jar.  However, I just can't bring myself to get hooked on a product that's going to cost me $500 plus a year to use.\",\n",

I have a lot of cystic acne problems and had read somewhere this was good for hormonal and cystic breakouts. (I'm not saying that is true since I am not a scientist but my face has improved so I wouldn't be surprised if the claim is legit.)

I do wish this product was more affordable....in this economy I have to struggle to pay the bills -versus- treating my unwanted (and unsightly, in my own opinion)skin conditions to make myself feel better.

What has made it more difficult for me to use products is that I have dry skin.  Products made to treat the acne portion of my Rosacea increase the dryness and redness.  Using a moisterizer or product to reduce the redness makes the acne worse. So I tried this. Not expecting much. And I can't believe it.  It immediately reduced the dryness and redness.  The inflammation improved. And the Acne? Started to heal. Really. I'm not kidding.  This stuff actually works.  As for the many reviewers comments about the price being high.  Think of it this way.  How expensive has it been going to doctors, paying for prescriptions or trying over the counter products you end up throwing out after 3 days?

Unfortunately that is not good long term, as the skin can\\'t \"breathe\" and the sloughing off of dead cells (natural exfoliation) is hampered. Unfortunately, I found this out after my cheeks and lower face developed patchiness. But the WORST ingredient to me is the SQUALANE which is from SHARK LIVER OIL (verified) which is obviously harvested from sharks. Not only does that seem unethical -  as \"approximately 3000 sharks are required to produce one ton of squalene\" (source: [...]) - the expensive cost of squalane (refined squalene) being a top ingredient in DERMAdoctor CC&C...is passed on to the consumer. While these ingredients may work for you, I need to look for a different solution.',\n",
