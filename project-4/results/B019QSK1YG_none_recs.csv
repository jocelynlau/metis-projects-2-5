I do love it and it lasts a long time. I apply to dry skin, and use an ample amount so my electric cleaner brush gets deep down into pores.

This stuff does the job so freaking good. I first got a sample n it lasted me 3 weeks n let me tell u this stuff leaves ur face so clean, shiny clean, skeeky clean, it leaves ur skin feeling like new. It removes all dead  skin cells, dirt,oil n makeup. It says on bottle to use every day morning n nite but I use it every other day cus I also use other dermadoctor products n I was told not to use them all at the same time.

WRINKLE REVENGE ANTIOXIDANT ENHANCED GLYCOLIC ACID FACIAL CLEANSER deep cleans without stripping natrual oils. It thoroughly removes makeup and mascara in a cinch and leaves your skin feeling refreshed. I follow up with witch hazel toner and astringent then Rare Minerals by bare escentuals before going to bed. After the first use, I could tell that my skin felt calm and refreshed. I have oily yet sensitive skin and after incurring rashes and red spots in the past, I am very careful to read labels and steer clear of harsh products.

Fragrance free is the way to go if you are looking for a cleanser for ""sensitive skin"".

See my full review on beautystat dot com. As with every Dermadoctor product I have ever used, this cleanser is absolutely best of breed. I never use cream cleansers because of my oily, acne-prone skin, but I bought it because I have never been disappointed with a Dermadoctor product. This cleanser removes every speck of makeup and makes my face feel clean, but not stiff or tight at all -- it is not like the oily skin cleansers I used as a teenager! My pores stay clear, and I rarely see a blackhead now -- and I noticed improvement after only one week of use. I can't recommend this product highly enough. I normally don't like creme cleansers because they smell or leave a residue on my face but this cleanser doesn't do that.

I used to have really oily skin but lately my t-zone has been dry & flakey.  I started using the cleanser & saw immediate results!  My skin seemed ""balanced"" and the flakey areas on my skin have gone away.  Overall my skin is a lot smoother and I've only been using it for a little over a week!

I don't have acne but do get little zits here & there and the surface of those areas seems to have smoothed out some in the short time I've been using it.

I don't believe this cleanser can fight wrinkles. I'm EXTREMELY skeptical on such claims!  I think if you truly want to get ""revenge"" on your wrinkles you'd have to go through some cosmetic procedures whether they're peels or whatever.  That's just my opinion of course...

I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  A little goes a lonnnng way & I highly recommend it!In short words this is the best cleaner ever. It leaves my skin so soft and glowing. Adult blemish is one of my problems, but since I'm using this cleaner, the blemish have disapeard and my sking looks healthier. This cleanser is amazing. I have a problem with clogged pores and sensitive skin. I normally hate cream cleansers because they tend to aggravate my acne prone skin. Not so with this one. Since using this cleanser my skin has become more even toned, softer, and less clogged. This removes makeup 100%, even waterproof or mineral makeups. I really love this product. This cleanser is also a great companion to the clarisonic facial brush. Used together these two products clear out clogs, smooth out rough patches, and even your skin tone. Sounds too good to be true but it's really not. This cleanser is worth every penny and then some. Just tried this tonight.  First of all, it does NOT take much.  Apply to dry skin. ... amazing! It made my face silky smooth and more ""even. ""  I am a stickler for products that smell/scent.  This product is low scent. I also am a stickler for my sensitive skin. ... It gets very red easily.  This product did not make my skin red. I did not have to follow up with a moisturizer tonight. .. didn't leave my skin dry and right.  I'm looking forward to day 2 and beyond. I love this facial wash, actually feels like it does help skin to look betterI wanted to leave a review because if your like me I read all reviews before I purchase anything at all! I was experiencing very bad adult acne on my forehead and sides of my face and nothing would clear it up. Drug store brands or high end brand so I decided to try this because it was for acne and age defying. Proud to say my acne is clearing up I could tell after first day it was working and it will dry you out a little but I use moisturizer and it goes swaysExactly what I ordered and much better price than in stores!  I think this works excellent as a 1-2 time per week usage.  You have to get used to the fact that you gently rub into a dry face and massage and then add water.  No scrubbing necessary.  Helps to exfoliate and remove blackheads and pimples.  I always feel fresh faced and tell myself that my wrinkles are just a little be lessened after each use:)I like this productI have used dozens of products. This is expensive but it is the only one that really makes a difference. I'm 52 and had oily skin with breakouts when younger. I use this product with a buff puff facial cleansing sponge. I take a few extra mins to massage it in then scrub around mouth and forehead where wrinkles are prominent . No one believes my age. Tried this product before I bought it. I had an unusual amount of break outs on my nick and chin after a coastal vacation.  I'm in my 50's and never had bad acne in my teens or 20's. DERMAdoctor Wrinkle Revenge not only helped my normal skin areas but cleared up and attacked these really ugly and inflamed acne areas. I will warn you it did burn a bit but within less than a minute that completely subsided and within one evening the infected area showed that it was healing. It did take a week to completely heal the really bad area but my skin was back to normal.

If you are using to remove wrinkles and you have sensitive skin and a T zone like I do. I would recommend using this only three times a week and use your normal face wash. To get the best results from DERMAdoctor I would follow the instructions and use it without water and rub a small amount through out your face and neck areas using an upward motion on your neck and face. You can then rinse it of with warm water and pad your face and neck dry.  I like the results and love the way my face feels afterwards!!!Love Dermadoctor products. The only time I ever get complimented on my skin is when using this product.  Not sure why I stopped and tried other things. Fast delivery.... thank you!  5-StarsAfter hearing about this product and reading the outstanding reviews on here I was sold! I purchased the wrinkle revenge 1 as well as the eye cream. I was so excited to use this product! When I first started it it would make my face burn and I'd have to lather on the moisturizer. Then I noticed the acne. I've always had some pimples occasionally but my entire face broke out. Even though I purchased this on amazon I stopped by sephora and talked to an employee there. She told me that the product was cleaning my pores and the acne was all the bad stuff coming out. She said this was normal for the first few weeks. So I continued with it. It has now been over a month and not only is my face still horribly broken out I have this weird scaly scabs on the sides of my face nears my eyes. They are horrible. My face is just covered in bumps. I cannot believe how this product got such great reviews! I have stopped using this and will never use it again. I have also researched glycolic acid and have read some horror stories so please look into glycolic acid before buying anything with it in it! Also their eye cream sucks too. I've been using it steadily and gave noticed no improvement to dark spots or puffiness. So needless to say i will not be purchasing another dermadoctor product again!!!Good stuffLove this productIt took Amazon to find it.. HOURS  jUST NEED TO SAY  FINALLY FOUND A PRODUCT THAT HAS ALL INGREDIENCE TO MAKE THIS AN EXCELLENT PORDUCT  THEN IT GETS PULLED OFF OR PRODUCT IS DISCONTINUED... DISHEARTENING....... I particularly like that you can get this product in a plastic tube. The stores now only sell it in glass containers. The glass design is not so good for the shower or for traveling. I have been using this cleanser for a little over a year now and absolutely love it. It is a lightless moisturizing cleanser that leaves your face clean, smooth and glowing. Acne has always been a major struggle for me. I have extremely sensitive and oily skin, and this cleanser has been the only thing I have found that relieves the oil problem without making my skin red. I still get acne, but so far the best overall reaction I have experienced from a cleanser. I have used this product for some time.  Works good for me. Helps with my adult acne.  And it doesn't over dry my skin. Horrible for oily skin... it doesn't lather, it just slides over my face. Not worth the money AT ALLComing from a cheaper store brand, the lotiony-ness made me nervous, but it turned out to be amazing. No stretchy shiny leftovers. Works as well as several store brand cleansers to remove oil and makeup. I never expect cleansers to get rid of mascara. I will be continuing to use this, or whatever bottle they switched to.

I have been a devoted pevonia user for years but product has been a disappointment. Phyto gel is a much better cleanser, gentle but still leaves skin smooth and clean. Non drying. I love Pevonia and have used it for 2 years since discovering it in a spa in CA on vacation.  I use various products from them but only find them this inexpensive on Amazon.  This product shipped very quickly and this seller's products were very fresh.  I have sometimes had problems with slightly foul smelling Pevonia cleansers on Amazon.  Highly recommend the product and seller.  Combination skin cleanser is somewhat perfumed unlike the sensitive skin cleanser but hasn't produced any reaction.  Very happy. Been a Pevonia fan for years... this is a beautiful light cleanser with the slightest scent of lemongrass. Good for removing make up and the day's dirt, and gentle enough that it won't irritate skin. Pairs well with the combination skin lotion, and has done wonders to keep my skin looking healthy and glowing. I loved it! Left my face feeling clean, soft and hydrate.  Good choice and good price. I used them before a couple of years ago and I got back to them because my skin was dehydrated and peeling. I have been using Pevonia skincare products for years. This is the best line of cleansers and lotions. Very calming for my skin. I have been using Pevonia products for 4 years and I love how I stopped breaking out from other heavier products. Some of the cleansers I have previously used left my skin feeling dry and tight..... Pevonia cleans very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.  I definately recommend it. I have been using this for two days and my skin looks brighter already!  I absolutely just love this cleanser!Love this cleanser.  I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this does wonders.  I have much clearer skin and it is so soft. not good broken cap and not very effectiveThis product is just ok. After reading reviews that it helped clear people's skin I decided to try it. However, I don't really notice a difference in my skin. This face wash is more creamy and doesn't lather, which I personally do not care for. It does smell nice though, like lemons. Outstanding product and face cleanserLove this product! I have used it for about a week now. No new breakouts and skin is clearing up. It has a light citris smell that is amazing and not overwelming. I have rosacea and it has even helped that! Great for my sensitive skin! Leaves your skin with a nice healthy glow. Good skin cleanser. i like the smell since it's not too strong. Will have to use makeup remover prior to using this cleanser, but it cleared out most of my breakouts. love it!Nice mild cleanser. Really good face wash. I'm the type that hated the squeaky clean feel after washing as I found that was the sign my skin was getting stripped of moisture. I purposely looked for a gentle cleanser, and enjoy the Pevonia very much. For reference, my skin is combo/oily, after washing it feels clean but still soft and smooth. No breakouts!Excellent productThis cleanser removes makeup easily and leaves your skin super soft. You need very little of it to work. I have been using this facial cleanser for over two weeks. I love the way it makes my skin feel clean without having so many harsh chemicals. It smells very nice and clean without being overpowering. Love this productI love the Pevonia line! Cleared my skin so well and this is my go to face wash!Would order again!Love Pevonia Products for my face. Keeps my skin clear and clean. I love Pevonia products! My skin always looks good when I stick to their products.  And I love the smell. Two things I dislike, leaves a waxy residue feeling on your skin and its no match for waterproof mascara. I look like Courtney Love after washing my face with this. Seems to just smear it around... I have to scrub the s*** out of my face to get the black smears off. So I have to wash my face after washing my face. Redundant.

Two things I DO like (but not enough to buy again) it has a nice lemon smell and it doesn't make my face feel tight or dry after using. Very gentle and long lastinggreat product for combination skinLove this face wash!Wonderful skin cleanser !Another great Pevonia product.  Love itGreat product :)perfect skin for yearsLight face wash. Sometimes I have to wash twice because I can't tell that I've cleaned my face. :/ but my complexion is clearer than before so ...  I guess it's working lolGreat cleanser and easy to use. Great product!!Just enough moisture for me. Removes makeup well with Claresonic brush. Not good for acne prone skinGreatMy skin feels supple after use of this cleanser without it feeling greasy. I see a slight reduction in my wrinkles as well and will continue to use this product. My mom loves these products.  They really help her skin stay looking young, and if you can get them at a good price, then by all means buy it for her. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT ... IT WAS RECD AS PROMISED .... AND I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN SOON.. Works very well and is easy on the epidermis.  This product is on my list of items to reorder. My absolute favorite I can't stand washing with anything else. I definitely noticed my oily combination skin is improving. Less clogged pores by the day. They are also getting smaller. This is an amazing cleanser..... never leaves your face feeling too dry.....

I use it every day, followed by their lotion. I love this and use it every day. its gentle and works even if I don't use toner after it cleans w/out stripping your face. I have been using this product for quite some time now. It works fabulous! This was a good buy. Great!!I try various other cleansers over the years, just because I am always looking to see if there is something even better out there.  I always come back to this.  I love the smell, too!Didn't like this product I wouldn't purchase againI really like this facial cleanser for when my face is already clean. For example I use a strong cleanser at night (after i've had make up on all day and my face is really dirty) and then i use this one in the morning to just freshen up my face. It does not remove makeup (definitely does not). But I actually love how gentle this cleanser is and it doesn't leave your face feeling dry. I would recommend it. Not really impressed with, doesnt lather up, so doesnt feel like it does anything more than other brands purchased. Also, was delivered without being shrink wrapped.

I bought Juice products after being recommended them bc I have very sensitive skin and was currently unable to handle any other products or make up. The cleanser was sssuuuuupppper thick. It felt like glue and didn't remove makeup. The serum and the moisturizer were nothing special. I felt no difference on my skin. The toning spray was like spraying acid on my face! sooo painful! my skin immediately turned red and irritated. I had to rinse it off immediately. Too scared to even try the apple peel. Ive heard great things about this line, but for me personally it didn't make my sensitive skin too happy. I would give it three stars if it didn't work. The package is very small. I ran out of the serum within a few days. Here are the ones I like the best. I love the CLEANSING MILK, HYDRATING MIST AND APPLE PEEL. They make my skin feel clean and gives my face a bright shine. When I wake up in the morning feeling drowsy and sleepy, I wash my face and feel like a brand new person. I am not fond of the Nutrient Moisturizer, I have combination skin, so the Nutrient Moisturizer really dries my skin out but does not replenish enough. Again the tube is really small, I have to buy more products to give an extensive review. I am in the process of doing that now. I have been waiting 40 years for this product.  I love this product!This stuff makes my skin feel soo soft! Im seeing alot of improvements with my skin in such a short period of timeGreat products. I like the serum, the lotion and the peel seems nice only used once.  It is the wash, it leaves you feeling greasy,I have been looking for non-toxic beauty products and I thought this kit was a good value to try. I really love the products, and I have to say that I can clearly see an improvement in my skin. It's brighter and more even toned, and I feel like I need less makeup now, after just a few weeks. I haven't even tried the mask yet. The antioxidant serum is the star of this show for me. I've already reordered the regular size. I would have given the kit 5 stars, but while the cleansing milk is nice, it doesn't do a great job of removing my eye makeup, and I really only wear mascara... It leaves me with major raccoon eyes and I have to go back in with eye makeup remover. Bottom line, if you are looking to try Juice Beauty, the kit is a great value and you may see noticeable improvement in your skin. I've been using Juice beauty products for years now and I absolutely love the product line! The SPFs are a physical as opposed to a chemical blocker and it suits my sensitive skin! The starter set is GREAT for those looking for a new skin care regimen or for travel!I have been trying different Juice Beauty products to see which works the best with my skin and the cleansing milk leaves my skin soft, smooth, moisturized. The same goes with this moisturizer, I am definitely getting a refill!Was very excited to try these natural products. The smell was horrible for three of the five products. Would not be able to use them. The cleanser was tolerable. Love the idea, but did not like the products. My skin is sensitive to it and my skin became like sand paper after trying. You may try it if your skin is not sensitive. I have to keep using  Avene, that never irritates my skin. I was really impressed with Juice Beauty from an ingredients standpoint and hoped that the actually products would deliver. Deliver they did! I had been having minor breakouts and patches of dry skin the past six months and couldn't find anything that would bring balance back to my skin. Within 3 days of using the system my face was back! The Senstitve Green Apple Peel is amazing and definitely works wonders. After rinsing the peel my face feels so smooth. The natural ""fragrance"" of the products are very light which I also like. I loved being able to buy the sample or travel size first. I purchased this item because I travel frequently for business and it's so hard to travel with my full sized organic face wash and creams. I was excited the first time I tried these products and will be purchasing moving forward for my travel bag. Hi there !
Just wanted to mention, that this product has ONLY organic certified ingredients, it has  NOT the USDA ORGANIC CERTIFIED Sticker sign . Some products of the Juice Beauty Line have the  USDA ORGANIC seal .
If  one wants to buy certified organic products , one may watch out for the real USDA CERTIFIED ORGANIC round Sticker. I was looking for organic face products and ordered this to try this line out.  The products smell delicious, and my skin feels so soft. I love the aroma and cleanliness of the product. It doesn't require a lot of product to get the results you're looking for. Very worth it. I got these for my daughter, she says they are just OK. She can be very picky. I love this kit, which I have bought from other stores before.  It lasts me several months with daily use and helps clear up my skin from minor acne.  I work in a kitchen, so my skin gets pretty icky by the end of the day.  When I use this exclusively I don't break out.  The moisturizer is fairly heavy and thick, but I have very dry skin so I like that.

My biggest concern is that I've tried to purchase this kit from Beauty. com, but they've canceled my order three times.  I'm not sure if they're out of stock or what. I really love this product! My skin has never looked better. I don't have bad skin, but have spent a lot of time on the ski boat, used to smoke and am in my 40's. The fine lines, dryness and blotchiness are soothed with this line of products. I recommend it so much that I have been giving this set to my girlfriends as birthday presents!Currently I use three of the five products. I don't have much use for the make up remover as I rarely ever wear make up. And I haven't used the hydrating spray. The face cleanser, the anti oxidant cream and the moisturizer are all great products. I especially love the green apple cleanser. My face feels wonderful after! The only thing that I would prefer is if the anti oxidant container were a little bigger and a set that doesn't include the make up remover and hydrating spray.

I recommend it so much that I have been giving this set to my girlfriends as birthday presents!giftLoved this product my skin has never felt
smoother love the scent. Shipping was fast packing nice. Would definitely purchase againFirst of all, it's probably my fault for not looking at the ounces of product but for some reason I just thought $42 of product was gonna get you decent trial sizes. Everything is pretty tiny except the cleansing milk. Second, I don't care for any of the products except the spray toner. Really disappointing.. Wonderful product. Great for travel!Recently updated my skincare regime to include organic and exfoliating products after reading an article about the benefits of exfoliating as you age, decided this product would be a great way to get started.

Chose this particular line as I was already a fan of their stem cellular CC Cream 12-in one multi- tasker SPF 30 as it contains an impressive amount of zinc oxide (20%) without leaving a chalky residue like may others I've tried. It also has a built in moisturizer and tinted with skin correcting color which meant I didn't have to layer my face in too many other products.

Hoped it would be the answer as I loved the fact that it was organic..... It wasn't but maybe it will work for you.
Here's what I found.
1. Cleanser was not effective enough to remove make-up in the evening so I used it in the mornings only followed by an organic exfoliating sponge.
2. Hydrating Mist left a sticky residue on my skin as a spray after cleansing and applying the serum (as recommended)... Will try using it as a toner with cotton wool to remove last traces of make-up instead as it contains great ingredients! I found my usual  Age Smart Anti Oxidant Hydramist  by Dermalogica works better for me especially after make-up application.
3 Anti Oxidant Serum, 2 samples not bad applied in the evenings!  Mornings I apply a Vit C Serum by Oz as I find this clear liquid absorbs easily into my skin with no residue before applying make-up.
4. Green Apple Peel sensitive, applied this twice a week in the evening as recommended. Very liquid felt a tingling after applying on cleansed and dry skin so imagine it was working.
5. Nutrient Moisturizer has a thick matt finish didn't work well under make-up for me. I was expecting so much  from this brand.. the image and all the company background etc sounds so amazing! But when I put this on my skin... OMG just terrible.. It gives itch and burn feeling, had to wash right away... Couldnt stand it! just too strong for my sensitive skin... too much fragance also. You get very little for the price & some of the products did not mesh well with my skin... I love the peel though, it is by far their best product and I will use the rest for travel because the small sizes work perfectly. I bought this kit at Ulta with much excitement and high hopes, and I wanted so badly to love it. Every time I applied one of the products, my skin turned bright pink/red and felt raw.

I tried them all together; I tried using just the cleanser with other moisturizers, just the serum with other brands of cleanser/moisturizer, and so on, but nothing worked. All five items irritated my skin to some extent. It shocked me because I have dry, flaky skin, but it's not normally so sensitive.

When I contacted the company, asking if maybe I was using it wrong or got a bad batch or something, I received no response. Not very promising on the customer service end.

So... since their stuff gets such high reviews, I imagine it's amazing for some people. Just... as a word to the wise, I'd recommend buying only a sample or two before investing all the way, just in case it happens to you, too. This is fantastic! I bought this travel size set as a way to test it out and it lasted over a month!I bought this set because I heard a lot of good things about Juice Organics and I wanted to try it out. Well, this kit is definitely for you if you were like me. The cleanser comes in a size that'll last you for (at least) a month, the peel size is bigger enough for two applications, the mist and moisturizer are big enough to outlast the cleanser by a month, and the serum should last you at least a week or two. And I know some may want to know what I think of the products effectiveness but personally I think product results for this stuff is subjective so just give it a try for yourself if you're already on the fence about it. On the other hand, I will say that the cleanser is a bit stronger than I expected. So if you have sensitive skin like me, either pass it along or don't leave it on for longer than a few seconds AFTER wetting your face.

I always get compliments on my skin and I just feel great when I use it. I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves them.  This little kit is great for travel.  She has full size bottles at home. I've read that Dr. Alkaitis products take some time to see results. I have a few favorites from the travel kit: will definitely be repurchasing the oil as it's LOVELY and can be used anywhere. I also really enjoyed the mask, I'm not really a mask type of gal either! And the night cream was pretty fabulous too. This is a great little kit to try out if you're interested in good, clean skincare that works!If you have never used Dr Alkaitis line of face products, this is a great way to sample and try everything out.
I loved the facial cleanser! It feels so nice and simple on the skin. It does not leave your skin feeling dry or tight. It leaves it feeling refreshed and comfortable
The herbal toner was just as great! It is light and leaves your face looking fresh.
The organic soothing gel is great with removing acne or blackheads. I had a couple of pimples when  started using this product, and within a week they had gotten smaller, or they disappeared.
The day/night creme is very moisturizing. It leaves your face feeling smooth and healthy. When you first apply it on your face, it does feel slightly oily. But within ten or twenty minutes it absorbs and feels great.
The eye creme definitely did its job! My daughter is a swimmer and her goggles leave her eye area very dry/irritated. When she started using the eye creme it felt great! It took away the dry and flaky skin and it now looks healthy.
The nourishing oil is different than I expected, but in a good way! I thought it would leave your skin to oily and greasy, but it absorbs very quickly and is an alternative moisturizer. It also smells so natural no added fragrance.
This also comes with a face mask, I haven't tried it yet but I am very excited! Based on the other products I am sure it will have good results.
Also with these products a little goes a long way. so these bottles will last you awhile. I definitely recommend these products to any skin type! I was very impressed. I also love that the ingredients label is all organic and natural, it feels great knowing what you are putting on your face. I have been using this product for a year and I am thrilled to say I achieve better benefits than when I used Estee Lauder or Lancome. I LOVE this line and my skin has never looked better. The products are so natural, you feel wonderful using them, and the aroma is very pleasant. just used this over the weekend for travel, perfect sizes, amazing products. I'm now buying the full sized products!I have trouble skin ( acne, dark spots) and I was trying to find something natural to use on my face. I chose the trial size because I did not want to buy the regular sized bottles and it turned out that my skin doesn't respond well to it. I only used the Cleanser, Day Cream, and Eye Cream and gave the rest to a friend. The stuff works great. I noticed a difference the next day. The products last for a good amount of time as very little product is needed for the face. It is a little expensive, however for something natural, organic, that truly works the price isn't bad compared to purchasing expensive products at Sephora or Macy's where the products are filled with ingredients that one cannot pronounce. Love these products and love this kit!  This is the best way to try all the products in the line at a moderate price.  Similar to what others have said, the products last long.  I typically only use one pump of each product for my whole face, and each item lasted at least a month (some products much longer).

As to the line, I love it so much, I'm now getting rid of all my other products and switching over to Dr. Alkaitis completely.  It's clean, gentle, and really works!  I was lucky enough to have great skin as a teenager, but in my late 20's to mid-30's, my skin is much more temperamental and prone to breakouts.  With many other products, I haven't recognized any noticeable differences.  With Dr. Alkaitis products, I can see and feel the difference.  I would recommend these products to anyone. Best product ever! No more inconsistent skin and no more acne. I have used other natural brands in the past (that vary in degrees of 'natural') and I find that I have to mix a moisturizer of one line with a cleanser from another line; however, across the board I really liked everything I sampled in this Dr. Alkaitis travel kit and I will be purchasing several items in the full size, including the cleanser, the toner and the moisturizers.

As a reference point, I have dry/dehydrated skin and I am interested in early anti-aging efforts.  I like Suki nourishing facial oil and Evanhealy toners, body oil, and shea butter.

Also, several other reviews have commented on the scent and the best way I can describe it is hints of clove/cinnamon; like a peppery-sweet scent. I don't love it as much as some of the other comments do, but I do not find it too overpowering. FAST SERVICE HOWEVER AND IT FELT NICE ON MY FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME USING IT, SO LETS SEE,  I'LL EDIT MY REVIEW  IN A WEEKlike the products, love the herbal scent and they feel gentle on the skin. I have not noticed any major changes in my skin but, at least i have not reacted to the products. I am a 34 year old who deals with cystic hormonal acne. My skin is unique being that it's normal to dry and breaks out. I am thoroughly impressed with this product as I have tried everything under the sun.

I mainly used the cleanser, toner, eye cream, soothing gel, and nourishing oil. The day and night treatment were way too moisturizing for my skin. At first my skin felt a little oily getting used to the new system, but now reacting well and actually looks healthy.

Cleanser: Pro- it cleanses well and don't leave my skin feeling taut or dry. Actually felt smooth and hydrated. Con- since the base is Castile soap you can't use it on eyes to take off makeup.

Toner: Pro- I LOVE this toner!! I am not usually a toner gal, but my goodness this stuff is heaven and leaves my skin feeling super refreshed! Cons- NONE

Eye Cream: Pro- moisturizing and felt like my small crows feet were erased. Cons- burns my skin so I stopped using it

Soothing Gel: Pros my favorite of all the product. Perfect for my skin as a moisturizer and very calming -I believe due to the turmeric -to my skin. I started to get a cystic acne (felt it forming under the skin) and what usually would've welted actually shrank and came to a head to be able to pop, which never happens! Cons: NONE!

Nourishing Oil: Pros- Smells Devine, and really is hydrating, but not too oily for my skin. Cons- didn't absorb as quickly as others said their did. Super pricey!

Overall this travel kit is the perfect way to start to try the products and lasted me a month. I would give 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive (although I am buying the full sized bottles) and if I could've used everything in the kitSince using this, my skin has never looked better. Kind of a miracleAlkaitis is one of very few brands to have probably understood the need for non-estrogenic compounds, totally non-toxic compounds, non-oxidative oils, and still making a product that gives the skin amazing glow and is truly aromatherapeutic.
Incredibly valuable if you care about only putting on your skin what you would in your mouth.... yes, it does absorb! Try taping a piece of crushed garlic to your leg for 30 minutes and you will see how strongly the garlic flavour appears in your mouth because the aromatic compounds in the garlic have already circulated throughout your bloodstream and soft tissues.... Then ask yourself if you would like that happening with industrial seed oils, benzene derivatives and hidden sugars that one finds systematically in most skincare products....
Alkaitis is my go-to choice now for the past year and I cannot imagine ever going back. Really great products with amazing ingredients.  Love the smells and consistencies.  Grew up using oils etc so I am used to essential/therapeutic oil scents. Love itWe really like the eye cream, however the other products do not do well with my skin.  The treatment oil works well for a body oil for me, however my face is too sensitive.  I ended up breaking out every time I used a drop or two. I gave it 4 stars because I think the products are great if they work with your skin type.  Unfortunately, my skin is just too sensitive. Love Dr. Alkaitis. This is a great trial kit, a great way to try out products before committing.  A little goes a long way, that will last for a couple of months. These products are great for sensitive skin. Great quality organic skin care set. Love night cream, which makes my dry and sensitive skin soft and calm. Fast shipping. I love this product!  I have dry, sensitive skin and have tried numerous products. The cleanser is the best that I have found, it doesn't dry out my skin and my skin doesn't flake as it has with other products. I can only speak for me but I would highly recommend it.. It is a little expensive but you only
have to use a very small amount.

Love the kit for traveling instead of trying to pack all the big, bulky jars of cleansing and moisturizing products. It really does last a long time.
Someone told me Gisele Bunchden loves this brand, so there you go, another reason to give it a try!Love these light, wonderful smelling treatments!perfect size for travel or sampling  love this productI have purchased Dr. Alkaitis products directly from the company in the past and I love them. These are adulterated. The treatment oil has a very faint scent and a thicker texture compared to what I got from the company directly. The creams were not creams at all but were the consistency of very thin soup. The soothing gel had no scent at ,and mixing it to see if it was separation did nothing to improve it. The soothing gel had very different sent and texture and seemed adulterated from what I used in the past. The packaging also look different and cheaper. Either Dr. Alkaitis has totally gone to the dogs or this is fake or adulterated product, or old and spoiled or not stored properly--not good at all!Great way to test out beauty line. Samples are a decent size. As these products tend to be on the expensive side (see amazing ingredients) this allows for a fair amount of testing time, especially the oil. Most of the pumps/applicators worked fine except the oil pump which sticks sometimes. These are natural so will not last forever. I think the toner and aloe serum went off after 9mos+.  These do have a strong smell as they are made with essential oils so not for everyone, but I liked them. I ended up purchasing multiple items from the line as a result. Will use the containers for further travel storage need. One of the best natural lines I have used.
The cleanser is a bit too ""soapy"" for my dry prone skin, but everything else is incredible. Love the gel, the oil, and the eye cream very much. If they create a cream based cleanser I will be set ! Be aware the products have a strong herbal scent. If you don't like the smell of plants then you may not like it, but I find it healing.

IT DISAPPEARS INTO SKIN AND FEELS GREAT.  I USE IT A. M. AND P. M.  NO MORE OILY T-ZONE.  I LOVE IT AND USE IT AFTER WASHING WITH AVENE CLARIFYING GEL, A NON-SOAP CLEANSER.  WHERE HAVE THESE PRODUCTS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?I have combination skin, with oily problem areas along my cheeks and jaw... sort of a reverse T-zone. I can use this all over my face. With regular lotions, my skin would start to feel greasy after a few hours. This mattifying fluid keeps my skin shine-free all day. That's reason enough to use it, but it also serves as a great primer. This lotion smooths over pores and leaves skin uniform. It's a great base for makeup. Even if you don't wear makeup, you'll appreciate the even non-greasy look this provides. I'd recommend this to those with oily or combination skin. A pea sized amount is all you need. Rub your fingertips together and pat on your oily parts. I've found too much will actually dry my skin out, so start conservatively. It's also has a fresh, pleasant scent and absorbs quickly. It worked really well at first. Towards the last of the bottle my cheeks started getting dry and flaky! Don't know if I would buy it again. This product is amazing!  Anyone one who has oily skin and must reapply powder mid day to absorb the excess oil, will enjoy the mattifying effect of this product. I read about it in a beauty magazine and it got rave reviews by multiple people. I decided to try it. It delivered on everything that was promised. This is the best  stuff ever, it is hydrating without being being greasy and the price is very reasonable for this product. I plan on buying other items in this line. Looking to get a clean, invisible, matte finish that doesn't clog pores? this product from Avene does it. Pair it with the emollient creme. I'm seriously falling in love with Avene products.  My skin gets less oily/shiny, even in the summer heat.  This Mattifying Fluid seems to act as a primer as well, making my foundation appear more natural and airbrushed, which thrills me because products sold as primers tend to occlude my skin and cause me to break out.  I have nothing negative to say about it.  The price is reasonable, so if you have oily skin, it's worth giving Mattifying Fluid a try. Very hydrating and light weight! Excellent for sensitive skin like mine!Fantastic! I just loved it!GreatI have oily skin and I Use this in the morning before I put on my makeup and it works really well. Doesn't make my skin break out. Have had oily skin my whole life..... first product to actually curtail the oiliness in my T-Zone! Not sparingly drying, either!I have been using Avene products for a long time and I am very satisfied with them. This fluid especially is what saved my very greasy and oily skin. It's so light weight and the ingredients are so natural, which was important to me. The packaging is sturdy and since it's a pump, you don't contanimate the product with bacteria. It is quite pricey for the amount you are getting, but then again it is a good product that works well. It absorbs quickly into the skin and it is matte which I love. If you are very oily and are looking for a mattifying moisturizer that will leave your skin hydrated yet matte, this is for you. I only use this as a night time moisturizer since it doesn't have an spf in it. Great!I've been using this for over a year now, it doesn't completely stop oil from appearing but does help considerably.  It is light in consistency and absorbs quickly which I appreciate.  No acne problems have resulted and it hasn't aggravated my rosacea. Really nice moisturizer. Great smell, never sticky on the skin, and seems to be well tolerated by sensitive skin types. Just wish the bottle was bigger. I love this stuff. It works great to keep my skin from being oily while still moisturizing like I need! Great speedy delivery too :)I really like this Avene Mattifying Fluid as a nice daytime moisturizer. I wish it had SPF however, because that way I would not need to layer two products. It is a nice gel like consistency that is moisturizing enough for my very oily skin (don't feel like I need anything else on to moisturize after it. ) The pump is sleek and nice, that is until I dropped it on the second day of use and it broke off. I now have to use a Q-tip each time to get the product out. It is a pain, but this is my fault (unless it is badly made and easily breakable, which it might be also. ) The biggest con to this product is that it is not mattifying at all. Like I said I have extremely oily skin. This definitely does not make my skin any oilier, which is a plus. It just doesn't soak up the oil or mattify very much at all though. This was my whole reason for purchasing, so therefore I will not buy it again. It really was quite a nice moisturizer though and I enjoyed it. I have not tried an Avene product yet (this is my third) that I have not liked!nice, but no better than what I have bought in the drugstore. Works well - recommended by my dermatologist. Keeps my super oiliness mattified without breaking me out. I like this product a lot it helps with shine much better thany any products I used in pastFor oily skin this did not work but it smelt good. This is not for oily skin. I don't want to waste this  so I just used it in my neck. I bought this because this is won an award in instyle  it doesn't mean that because they won an award this will be good so I guess individual results vary. This product received a great review from Allure magazine, which prompted me to buy it.  It truly does make your skin more matte with continued daily use, even when the product is not on.  I use it every morning under sunscreen. I started out really liking this product, and was glad I found it available on amazon, after reading all about it via Allure and In Style.

It *is* a good product- however, I find it sometimes ""pills"" on my skin.  Don't know if I'm not shaking the bottle enough or what.

I've purchased this 3 times.  Lately, I grow less enchanted with it.  Maybe because it's summer and therefore waaaay more humid? (I live in Florida).

May look for another solution.  Avene does moisturize lightly and goes on smoothly.  The only thing I don't like is, it highlights the area under my eyes/above my cheeks, making it look too shiny.  I don't want to emphasize the hollows starting to form, in those areas!  Have to pat down with powder. Avene is one of the best brands for sensitive, acne prone skin. I don't know how they do it, but its moisterizing and mattifying all at one. One a good skin day, I use it alone, and a bad one, sometimes use it as a base for my make up application. I have very oily skin and this made my problem worse. Minutes after applying my skin was shiny and had a dewy look. Waste of money never buying again. Not an effective moisturizer at all. Makes oily skin break out even more. Please save your skin and not use this product. My face was always oily, but after using this, it 's hydrated and clean! I love this product so much!!!!!!!!!!!Love the feeling on my skin no perfume smells just love it!!!Feels more like a cream rather than fluid. Makes my skin feel greasyI bought this with the foam cleanser of the same line because I read something that claimed both of them together would help keep my oily skin under control... that was wrong.  This thing actually made my skin oilier.

I did like that it was light weight but my skin felt sticky for a bit after. I've used lots of Avene products, and sadly this is not one of my favorites. I think there is a fine line between mattifying (absorbing the oil) and drying (causing excessive flaking of the skin) and for me this fluid is too drying. Now if I want to use it I mix a drop of the fluid with another face product, which seems to work better. Plus, it lasts longer, because the price on Amazon is quite high. As with all Avene products, it's much cheaper at a pharmacy or airport in Europe. It's very light, I love it!My daughter researched this product for me. I have combination skin and this product minimizes shine while moisturizing. Feels light on the face. Perfect under make up, hot days, or under the avene spf optimal cream. I love the product, highly recommended. ","['THIS CREAM IS MOISTURIZING AND SOOTHING AS WELL AS MATTIFYING.', 'IT DISAPPEARS INTO SKIN AND FEELS GREAT.', 'I USE IT A. M. AND P. M.

My skin doctor says my skin is in great shape. I am 61 years old. This is my absolute favorite skin care product of all time AND it was significantly cheaper on Amazon; I had been on an auto ship with dermstore. com and had stopped buying becuase of the price so I was extremely excited to get three on amazon for the price of two at dermstore. I have extremely, extremely sensitive skin. I discovered Pevonia 6 or 7 years ago and used the Roseacea line for a while before switching to this C Complexe. It doesn't have much of an odor and is very light so great for layering. This is a great way to get some C into your skin care regime that isn't harsh. My skin has improved significantly since using this and for a few months when I didn't use it people noticed the difference asking if I was tired or didn't feel great becuase my skin didn't have the same glow. I would suggest to anybody to buy this, can't say enough how much I love this product and will sacrifice buying something else to keep this in my daily regime. Glad to have found it a bit cheaper on line. The product is wonderful and makes my skin feel so nice. This product is great to help with the hydration of your skin.  I use it everyday and night in conjunction with the other products of Pevonia. Nice to wear daily. Love the product. This can be used for every day application. I will continue to order the product. I love this line.  This serum is light yet powerful. It, along with the night serum have done great things for my skin.  Try thr Clairsonic Mia and the Dermawand too. This is a MUST have product. I have been using it for years and it protects your face from the elements. It helps so much with hydration and age defying. I love it. This product feels great on my face, however didn't really improve the redness at all.  Not really worth the price paid. I really love all Pevonia products, but this product is one of my all time favorites of Pevonia.  I use it every day, in the morning after cleansing, as my ""moisturizer. ""  It doubles as an antioxidant/anti-aging product since I am in my early 40's.  Pevonia makes such great skin products; the fragrances are so clean and natural and they don't have parabens.  The products are high-quality and stable on the shelf... the product is the same at the end of the bottle as when you first opened it--they don't change in texture, color or smell.  The ""C"" Complexe is worth every penny. The good: smells fresh but not overpowering, doesn't break out my combo skin, does contribute to smooth skin over time

The less than good: it's expensive (but markedly cheaper on Amazon), it's not a game changer in terms of results

The facts: I have used 1 pump of this roughly 5 - 6 nights per week after cleansing and toning since early to mid May and I have about 1/3 of the bottle left. I like it, but I think it's too expensive for what it does. It's a luxurious product that smells great and does smooth out your skin a bit over time (I'm in my mid-20s but am no porcelain doll, skin wise) but I think there are other similarly priced serums on the market that give better results. Love it! I look youngerI loved this product so much! I was receiving so many compliments on my skin while I was using this product. I would have given it 5 stars. However, the bottle only lasted a month and it is super expensive to buy every month. Looking for a cheaper version of this product. An amazing product.. leaves you face feeling fresh. Love it I have used Pevonia for well over ten years and always receive compliments on my complexionNice product.... have always loved Pevonia!effectiveI want to love this product, but it breaks me out whenever I try to use it.

I have been using it for years. effectiveLove it I have used Pevonia for well over ten years and always receive compliments on my complexionThis was recommended to me, and I used it. Perhaps not a miracle worker, but definitely good for my face!not sure if this is up to par with the vit c I get at my dermatologists office, but so far it seems ok. Fast delivery of the genuine product. I have used several Pevonia products for over 15 years and have always been happy with the results on my now 64 year old face and neck/chest area.  I also get compliments on my skin as well, including how good I smell during hugs and I don't wear perfume.  I added this C complex with oxyzomes about a year or so ago on a more regular basis.  I use to only use it in the summer after being in the sun a lot.  Now that I use it daily, I can tell a marked improvement in my skin, including smaller pores, softer skin and a more even tone.  I highly recommend it for use after Pevonia's 'lotion'/toner.  I also very much appreciate Amazon's prices.

Update 7. 29. 17: I started getting several non acne tiny bumbs on my forehead so discontinued using the C complexe only on my forehead as I wasn't getting them anywhere else & could only attribute the bumps to having added this on a regular basis.  After only two days of discontinuing this, the bumps went away.  I thought it only fair to share this in case you too have ultra sensitive skin.  I'm still using it everywhere else, as I still believe in the product; just that my forehead doesn't.  I've gone back to the Pevonia DNA for my forehead pores. I can't say enough good things about this product!  It was recommended by a woman who did my facial at an upscale spa.  She seemed sincere in her recommendation, so I took a chance.  My skin looks terrific.  Apparently vitamin C is one of the best things you can 'feed' your skin.  My skin looks fresher and more alive.  I am 63yrs old, so am thrilled to find a product that takes a few years off my faceMade me break outNot an adequate moisturizer. It absorbs quickly but leaves me somewhat dry. I have a combination skin with very dry forehead and oily nose. I primarily got this for my hyperpigmentation, and so far it's not helped making my dark spots much lighter. On the plus side though I feel like my pores look much smaller now, which is a great unexpected benefit!Very happy with this product!  I have noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin in just a week.  I love all the Pevonia products!Good","['I use this on my face in the morning.', 'I use 5 pumps along with another product.', 'My skin doctor says my skin is in great shape.', 'I am 61 years old.', 'This is my absolute favorite skin care product of all time AND it was significantly cheaper on Amazon; I had been on an auto ship with dermstore.', 'com and had stopped buying becuase of the price so I was extremely excited to get three on amazon for the price of two at dermstore.', 'I have extremely, extremely sensitive skin.', 'I discovered Pevonia 6 or 7 years ago and used the Roseacea line for a while before switching to this C Complexe.', ""It doesn't have much of an odor and is very light so great for layering."", ""This is a great way to get some C into your skin care regime that isn't harsh."", ""My skin has improved significantly since using this and for a few months when I didn't use it people noticed the difference asking if I was tired or didn't feel great becuase my skin didn't have the same glow."", ""I would suggest to anybody to buy this, can't say enough how much I love this product and will sacrifice buying something else to keep this in my daily regime."", 'Glad to have found it a bit cheaper on line.', 'The product is wonderful and makes my skin feel so nice.', 'This product is great to help with the hydration of your skin.', 'I use it everyday and night in conjunction with the other products of Pevonia.', 'Nice to wear daily.', 'Love the product.', 'This can be used for every day application.', 'I will continue to order the product.', 'I love this line.', 'This serum is light yet powerful.', 'It, along with the night serum have done great things for my skin.', 'Try thr Clairsonic Mia and the Dermawand too.', 'This is a MUST have product.', 'I have been using it for years and it protects your face from the elements.', 'It helps so much with hydration and age defying.', 'I love it.', ""This product feels great on my face, however didn't really improve the redness at all."", 'Not really worth the price paid.', 'I really love all Pevonia products, but this product is one of my all time favorites of Pevonia.', 'I use it every day, in the morning after cleansing, as my ""moisturizer.

I am in my late 30s and have very dry skin. For the past 10 years, I only used Creme de la Mer as any other product I tried (I have tried pretty much all major brand moisturizers) left my skin dry and stiff in just a few hours. Although I loved La Mer products, I hated its exorbitant prices! And finally, I don't have to shell out 300 dollars on a face cream any more! I put nothing but this oil on my face before bed and in the morning my skin is plumper and smooth. I love love love this product. I wear it during the day under a sunblock and it keeps my skin moisturized for the whole day. I love the wonderful flowery aroma of the oil too. My 3rd bottle, do I like it? I like the scent of this face oil and the changes I have seen and felt in the texture of my skin. Makes my skin feel very soft.  Waiting on the firming part... My wife loved it !!!Great product!:) for oil skin also. This lotion adds so much moisture your skin looks and feels youngerI love this face oil.  It goes on smoothly and leaves your face fresh and supple.  I highly recommend it. Great suff if you have very dry skinit is my second time to buy this item. I like it. it moisturizes face and comfortable. I bought this product at Pharmaca a couple of months ago. I was skeptical about the age-defying claim of this product, but since I'm at the age where I could use a little help I thought I would try it. I notice that my skin is firmer (a bit less wrinkled) and the cool part is that my skin looks like it is glowing. I plan to continuing using this product because I like the results so far. Love this product. Staple item for me. Oils as moisturizers are underrated.  Im 42 and look 35 or less thanks to this oily magic!i paid $225 for a simular oil, and this is just better.  great texture, and the next day your skin is smooth. Do not like smell or consistencyI've been using this face oil for a few days now and am impressed after I shower at night, my face feels very smooth. At 70 I need all the help I can get!goodseems to be doing something positiveWeightless and very moisturizing. Smell really nice, but not over powering. I have rosacea and it does not irritate my skin at all.  Even my husband likes it. Great, my skin is dry. I like oils a lot on my body as well, super soft skin after, just feel great. Great oillove this productI like it, however it seems a little dry, I had to mix it with rosehip oilHave used this oil for 2yrs. I tried others for less money but they didn't perform like Jurlique. My skin is slightly oily but still absorbs nicely. Seems to make fine lines disappear. You can order with confidenceVery goodI love it! Living in Florida I find it uncomfortable to use creams. Creams and lotions doesn't  mix well with high humidity and hot flashes.
This oil is so light and a few drops go a long way. It hydrates my skin without feeling oily. Really wonderful facial oil. I use it at night and wake up feeling like my skin is hydrated and happy. Also has a really good smell. The bottle seems like it will last a while as well!Excellent facial oil. I use it at night by itself and in the morning add a drop to my regular face lotion.  As you only use 1-3 drops this bottle last quite a while. My first time trying oil moisturizer. I love it! It soaks in so nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth through the morning. Not sure about anti aging benefits. This is my second Jurlique purchase, the other being a rose lip balm. I love how beautiful the product smells... sort of like a more natural and sexy baby oil scent. I don't really know how to describe the scent notes; perhaps a bit rosey and clove like?

I have combination skin that is pretty delicate and during the winter months I tends to get super dry cheeks and eyebrows.

I've been using this face oil for about 5 days; I apply this liberally as right now, this is the only moisturizer I am applying at night. I try to let it soak in a bit and then pat on another layer in before hitting the sack. I find that when I apply right before bed time, it rubs off and then I wake up with slightly drier skin; probably because I smoosh my face allover the pillowcase.

trust which is very great business relationship with customers.
buyers need to trust them  and buy it because i have great positive feel with them. Remarkable serum. I have the sensitive skin inclined to the rosacea. I tried a set of cosmetic creams. This Pevonia Botanica RS2 Gentle Concentrate the most effective. Perfectly moisturizes, calms irritation and provides healthy and equal complexion. I highly recommend. Not for me.  Was looking for something to help as my usual products weren't working as well.  Always get mild flare ups at change of seasons.  Rosacea flared up even worse with this.  I don't believe in the adjustment phase that some people mention.  If I had continued to use it for several weeks as they mention, I would have had the absolute worst case of my life (past 20+ years). I highly suggest getting this to use after your lotion and before your moisturizer. I use only 2 pumps for my face and neck. Nonirritating and lightweight but effective. I have mild rosacea and this works wonders when used with the Gentle Cream.  Just a few drops is enough for the entire face, which means that the serum should last quite a while.  It has helped calm my rosacea to the point where I don't need to apply Finacea daily. I am using this every morning first after cleansing. then followed by Osmotics Renovage. This routine is new to me so I am not sure if it is this combo or just one of the products but after a couple weeks My rosacea looks a lot better. This item did not come from Amazon but from a company called Quuen Bee Supply. When I didn't receive te order - I contacted them and they gave some story about lost in the mail (I don't believe for an instant that they ever sent it. ) then they said they woudl resend immediately - and still didnt. Their website listed no phone number, their email replies were written in substandard English and I felt they were snowing me. The woman who replied continually said she was ""looking into it"" after two weeks of no order showing and spotty replied I cancelled the order and woudl NEVER order from them again. That they are still a supplier choice for Amazon is astounding! I've never had a problem with any Amazon order and this one was pretty bad. the run around and Queen Bee blaming the Post Office - for losing it in the mail is pretty sleazy.

Sometimes I feels so raw its painful. This stuff works wonders! Its very lightweight and non-greasy, so you can use it during the day or at night. I usually use it alone, but you can combine it with lotion. After using the cream for over a year, I decided to try this to see if it would help with my continued breakouts due to rosacea.  I noticed a burning sensation upon application to my face. Within a week my peri-oral dermatitis had flared so badly that I needed to visit the dermatologist and get that under control. I only have mild rosacea, but this did not agree with my skin. I will not be buying this or any other pevonia products in the future, as they are now a flaring product for me, which is disappointing because I really liked the face cream.  I guess the enemy of good is better, right?One of the best products I have ever used to help my Rosacea. Not sure I am seeing the results I expected, and found myself breaking out (which I never do) shortly after starting with this product. Will give myself a break and try again to see if that helps, but the breakouts were worse than my redness. The best product I have found for my face.
Pevonia products are so worth the money.
They last a long time too. Very good. Have used for years. I have used Pevonia products, particularly their RS2 Concentrate & RS2 Lotion, for almost 15 years. Having been diagnosed many years ago with a facial redness condition known as Rosasea, Pevonia has been my go-to product. I highly recommend these RS2 products to anyone with this condition. It really helps!I use this product in conjunction with the lotion, the cleanser, & the face cream.  The rosacea product line by Pevonia is the only line that gives me relief from the itching, burning, & redness caused by my rosacea.  The products are not inexpensive, but it is a fantastic investment in my skin!I just love to put on this serum and lotion at night. Definitely helps with red skin, doesn't dry skin out or feel greasy, it's just right. I have sensitive skin and have been using all 4 of the Pevonia RS2 line... my face never feels irritated and has helped my redness... great products!good product . love Pevonia productsgood productPevonia products are fabulous. The redness has diminished a great deal. I love this product and have been using it for years for my Rosacea. Very pleased with the shipping process and appearanceFirst of all let me preface in saying that I love these products and they have done wonders in reducing and controlling the rosacea. But as in all things not everyone can use this product. I recently  found out that someone can have essential oil allergies and or allergies to  licorice. If you were one of these people beware because this product has all natural essential oils and look gross extract. If you feel any itching or burning you might want to check with your allergist or Dr.  As for me, I have none of these allergies and this product has worked wonderfully for me. Just wanted to make people aware that even natural essential oils can cause allergic reactions. Great product and I love it. I am baffled that this concentrate is supposed to do anything other than making its user sick from the awful smell.  I have never in decades of facial creams, lotions, serums and masks, smelled something so rancid, strong, offensive and nauseating.  Once again, I learned the hard way to not be swayed by customer reviews. 20 year consumer of pevonia. did not observe much benefit from this specific product.

Unfortunately it has been discontinued, so I've only been able to order though Amazon. com and have it delivered to a UPS store by the border (I live in Canada and it's not available for a reasonable price at Amazon. ca), it's completely worth the drive!This is the best exfoliation cleanser I have ever used.  Have tried many others, but this one really works. . no kidding!!This is the very best exfoliation cleanser I have ever used and believe me I have used ""many""! I like the fact that there are no artificial colors or fragrances with natural ingredients. It works very well with the DDF cleansing system and I use it 2 times a week.  It really makes my skin soft and smooth and even reduces pours, (somewhat)!  I am so happy that I can get this cleanser in a 6. 0 tube instead of buying the complete kit with brushes and sponges to use with the cleansing machine. (that only has a 2. 0 size cleanser tube)  The only problem that I am having is that I am under the impression that the complete replacement kit with the cleanser, brush and sponges is or may be in the process of being discontinued.  Granted, right at this time I do not need the replacement items but I will in the near future and I want to be able to purchase them again and it seems this kit is getting more difficult to find all the time.

It's mild enough to use 1x per day or few days, but the beads are also nice and coarse. I'll keep buying this stuff. Not sure why I purchased this.  I have other cleansers which do a better job. I developed some type of allergy to eye creams and cleansers.  Tried this because it is without any of the alcohol or chemical additives.  Works great and no further issues. The smell is quite unpleasant; for the price, you don't get very much of it; and it scarcely removes any trace of makeup--and I use a light application of mineral makeup, not anything heavy. I have to wash my face again with something else to remove the remainder. I won't repurchase. Gentle enough for everyday use. I have Rosacea, and it makes my skin soft and is non irritating. Please note that this is NOT a makeup remover. It also does NOT have a perfume scent. Highly recommended!!I saw this in a magazine and it sounded so promising, so I decided to try it out.  The magazine description and other reviews talked about it's fresh scent, well there was no scent at all, and it smelled old, like it was bad or something.  Also there was no lather for it being a cleanser, it was more like a medium paste consistency with soft exfoliating beads and was more like a very weak scrub.  Too much bother to return it, so there goes $22 dollars down the drain. very gentle exfoliator and very great product!I love this product, although it does dry my skin in very cold winter weather. I love this face wash! The jojoba beads are gentle enough for me to use daily on my sensitive and acne prone skin, but also enough that I no longer have to use a separate exfoliater during the week. I will definitely repurchase. My wife uses this product and has for a little while now. Her face is smooth and has a certain shine about it. It worked so well for her we gave some to my step son to try on his face as he suffers from bad acne. It has helped his face clear up very nicely. We are going to keep ordering this product as it seems to help both my wife and step son with their skin. Have had this for about a month, but have only used it 3 times. I like the grainy consistency, it's not too rough, and scrubs nicely. However, what I don't like is that it leaves a lotion-y film on my skin after I've washed it off; I need to use a cleanser after it. Love this stuff. If you are into organic products, this is great. Works well and chemical free. Nice cleanser for my troubled complexion.... I first ordered the Juice Beauty Exfoliating Cleanser. There were barely any exfoliant particles in it. And it didn't really wash off any of my makeup or normal daily grime so I further researched the product and contacted Juice directly. They explained that it isn't really intended to remove makeup, which seemed odd, and recommended I try the Cleansing Milk instead. Well, the Cleansing Milk isn't much better. It only smears my eye makeup around and doesn't completely remove my foundation. If I use a makeup removing wipe afterwards, there's quite a bit of foundation leftover.
I do not recommend these cleansers but do love the following from Juice: Nutrient Moisturizer, Smoothing Eye Concentrate, and Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30. Great product but the smell is a bit off. I use this with my inexpensive CVS power face brush and the results are wonderful.  I moisten my face, put a small dab in the center of the brush and turn the brush on high.  Using almost no pressure, it buffs my face, removes dry skin  (I use Retin-A Micro Gel) and leaves my face soft and glowing.  Just a rinse and pat dry.  Beads in the cleaning serum are jojoba oil beads, nothing in the product to irritate or damage sensitive skin. At 70, my skin is almost wrinkle free and smooth.  This product leaves it glowing and younger looking.  Can't say enough good things about it. Really creamy, smells like seasame oil. I feel like it barely exfoliated my skin. not for me, try it, it might works for you.
i have difficult skin, so i can not blame this product. I was hoping this would be a better product given the price. After a few weeks of use (twice per day), my face was really dry and I had to switch back to my previous cleanser. For this reason, I would not repurchase the product. I've been using this for the past few weeks now and I like it. I've had no bad reactions to it and overall my skin feels and looks nice. I'm experimenting with cream vs gel cleansers and I like this one, but not sure if I'm completely sold on the cream yet. I do like the beads which help to exfoliate while cleansing. I LOVE Juice Beauty products but the Exfoliating Cleanser that I ordered online via Amazon does not look or smell like the product I ordered off of the Juice Beauty website, or purchased in-store at Ulta.
This product has a very odd smell and the color is more orange than the typical white/off-white product that I have previously purchased.
Overall, I am pretty disappointed. I will absolutely order my products off of other sites in the future...
I am not convinced that what I received was the original Exfoliating Cleanser made by Juice Beauty. I bought this after watching a youtuber recommend this. I've got to say, the first time I used it I was like ??what??
This thing has a slightly weird smell and it is very thick and slightly oily to the touch. The exfoliating beads are also barely there. But, the ingredients in this are really good so I decided to use it for a little while and see.
After I used this for about 2 weeks, my skin seems to have adjusted to this and I genuinely like it. This makes my skin very soft and smooth. It's really moisturizing and it's cured the flakiness of my skin that usually happens during winters. This might not be as great to use in the summer though but I've really enjoyed the gentle exfoliation of the jojoba beads. Overall, I'd say I'd buy it again next winter to keep my skin baby soft. Buyer beware - these products are, I believe,  meant to be used with some type of rag or scrubbing device to really achieve a deep clean feeling - if haphazardly smoothed on your face, you WILL notice that your makeup isn't gone and there's quite a bit of oil/dirt left behind as well.  If used with scrubber, I do think that these products are better for the skin than other harsher soaps - I do see a difference in my skin, but it's hard to get over how much effort it takes. I have used this product for a few years and still love it! It is perfect to place in the shower. Has a bit of a oatmeal type texture, which I think some people don't like, but I personally love. I really like how this product exfoliate but isn't to harsh if used properly. I hate how some are so intense! This one is perfect to use when getting in the shower. makes my skin very soft. Love Juice Beauty. Clean and good for dry skinLove this cleanser. It's so soft and a little goes a long way. I really like Juice Beauty products. This cleanser leaves face clean and smooth. Left skin feeling oily and certainly not clean. exfoliates your skin without drying it out. In fact, my skin is very soft after washing it off. A pleasant surprise. Love using it - skin feels clean, smooth and youthful. When I bought this, I was looking for something cruelty free and potentially environmentally friendly. This brand fits both of those needs. It smells a bit spicy like a jalapeno but it doesn't hurt or anything. It feels super great for exfoliating, and you can feel it working. There aren't a lot of beads in the cleanser, but it still feels great afterwards. This in not the real deal.  It smells like dirt!  The product does not get my face feeling clean like the bottle I bought at Ulta. I can't stand to wash my face with it! I bought this as a refill for my previous bottle, which I had not run out of yet. Now that I've started using it, the return window has expired, so now I'm stuck with this disgusting imposter!Old product! This is not the same thing that youd get if you order directly from their website. It smells old and broke my face out.

214,0.8125241075741125,B019QSK1YG,B00GM3ZQXK,B00GM3ZQXK,Julep All-Natural Charcoal Konjac Sponge,"liked it at first, feel apart pretty quicklyReally like how my face feels after using.... very smooth. Love the konjac sponge. I ordered this and almost changed my mind on it, just because I thought it might end up being just another sponge that wouldn't really achieve what I wanted, but so glad I tried it out anyway, because I was so wrong.

This has already become a favorite, and after only one use so far!

Don't be alarmed... it does arrive wet in the packaging (but sealed) which is intentional and I presume to stop it from drying out during delivery. I didn't have any issue with it smelling like someone else mentioned, but I did still rinse it thoroughly before using it.

How to describe this... it's like a squishy rubbery thing, but in a good way! It exfoliates very gently but you do feel like it's actually polishing your face, just not in a harsh way. I usually use a wash cloth in the shower as it's the only way I've found to remove dry skin and my face doesn't feel clean unless I use it. The problem with a washcloth is that it can be too easy to scrub a bit too hard, and I once got small abrasions on my chin from over scrubbing. But I just know I won't have this same issue with this sponge, because it's so gentle and I don't think it's possible to overdo it.

This is easily becoming addictive! I've only used it once so far (it just arrived) but I just couldn't stop polishing my face with it. My body was jealous that my face was getting all the attention! It just feels so nice on the skin and already my face feels very clean and polished, after just one use. The polishing is truly a bonus which I wasn't expecting. I get dry skin, but can report that after first using this I had no speck of dry skin on my face, especially around my nose, which is usually a problem area for me.

Some on here mention replacing it every 3 months, which I plan on doing. I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to keep this hygienic in the meantime? I'm reluctant to dip it in alcohol incase it gets ruined, but at the same time I want to avoid bacteria growing on it, so it doesn't end up on my face. It arrived wet in the bag so I don't think you're supposed to dry it out either. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I will try using the sponge with a cleanser, but I found even just with water in the shower was very effective, so you can use it either way.

I highly recommend trying this! I can't wait for my next shower so I can use it again, lol!Love this. No face scrub necessary, light exfoliation and calmed my acne. I own it, use it, love itI got this in my julep box, what the heck is this? I tried to use this to remove makeup with cleansing balm, did not work out well. This is a strange sponge, feels odd, was wet in the product bag and just weird.  I'll try it again in the shower, but I don't have high hopes. Id seen these sponges advertised by another vendor but, with shipping and handling, thought the cost a bit too much to try. However, that changed when I found them on Amazon. I have a mild case of rosacea and have to be careful with what I use on my skin. I am very impressed with this product and am very glad I ordered it as a subscription. After the first use, my skin was smoother and the redness on my cheeks and forehead was markedly decrease. Im very, very satisfied and will be recommending them to friends and family. Love it. Ever since I got this, I've been in love with it! It's soft on the skin, yet still offers enough vigor to get the job done. This particular sponge in Julep' s line helps to thoroughly clear out pores and, in turn, reduce the perceived size of them in addition to having antimicrobial properties, making it great for acne. As someone who has enlarged pores from makeup usage and acne prone skin, I've seen massive improvement in the quality of my skin, which is now smoother and softer. I would highly recommend this product if you have any of the following:
-Large pores
-Sensitive skin
-Heavy product buildup
-Acne prone skinDidn't really help my skin. Tried it alone and with product. Great product.  Great quality.  My skin is too sensitive to use every day.  Have purchased more and use e/o day.  The drugstore ones do not hold up near as well as this.  Otherwise - no complaints. This is a nice, everyday sponge.  It feels pleasant on the skin and makes washing your face feel more spa-like.  As for the exfoliation, it's hard for me to tell.  Now that I'm in my 30's exfoliation has become a REALLY important part of my skincare routine because I've noticed when I exfoliate regularly my serums, oils and creams seem to work better and my wrinkles are MUCH, MUCH less pronounced.  This isn't enough on its own to COMPLETELY take care of my exfoliation needs (but neither is my Clarisonic or a wash cloth), but does seem to compliment the rest of my routine well without overstripping the skin.  I personally think my Clarisonic is my absolute favorite way to cleanse my skin, but much prefer this to a wash cloth or hands alone. First of all, to the reviewers who say this dries out and is done... it's not. You just get it wet and it fluffs right back up. While I wouldn't consider this an exfoliating sponge because it's so soft, I will say that it has improved the clarity and texture of my skin. I don't really understand how it works, but it does. It's a super soft, squishy, gentle cleansing sponge. It works better than my Clarisonic, which surprised me! I'm ditching the Clarisonic for this sponge. It just feels so nice on your skin. I've been using it for about four months now, which is longer than recommended, and it's still in the same condition as the day I bought it. I'll replace it soon. However, I bought one for my husband at WalMart by the EcoTools brand for $3 and it seems just as nice, if not softer, than this one. I'm going to give the cheaper one a chance and see if it works as good. I also like the shape of the EcoTools sponge better; it's more of an egg shape and fits easier in your hand. But this Julep sponge is definitely worth adding to a Julep subscription box. Not sure I'd pay the full $12. I do love it though. I bought this directly from Julep as part of a beauty box. I like any kind of scrub/exfoliator, though I have to be careful with my sensitive skin. It does have an odd, almost slimy texture straight out of the bag, but a couple of rinses in warm water took care of that. I used 1-2x day, and after about a week my skin was very smooth! Even the rougher places had become smoother. I really like that it can be used with or without a cleanser. It only needs a dab of cleanser, which makes it last longer- added bonus. I still use moisturizer morning and night. Because it is pretty gentle, my guess is that people who don't see results may not be using it long enough to tell. And like any skincare product, just may not work for everyone. But for me, this is the easiest and best skincare item I've tried in years. Dried out right away and wasn't usefullove these things. see a difference in my skin. highly rec. This sponge is the perfect sponge to use on your face. It gently exfoliates leaving skin smooth without irritating it. Use with or without soap. Make sure to rinse it out well, squeeze out the excess water and hang it somewhere where it will air dry. I've tried lots of konjac sponges and this one is my favorite. It's the only one that I received moist and pre-softened. Konjac is always really gentle on my skin but this was even more gentle because of the preconditioning. It's also light green where most I've used are usually black. I can see easier that this one is clean when I'm using it. It's also easy to clean and press out the water after. If you haven't tried this type of sponge before I highly recommend trying it. My skin is very sensitive and flakey so this rubs off the outer layer of skin very gently, grips it and pulls it away leaving my skin more refreshed. It's very natural and doesn't irritate my skin. These last me a few weeks each so it's something I always need more of. This isn't much of a sponge. It's not very abrasive, so it doesn't do anything to exfoliate skin. It had a really weird scent at first, but that went away over time. It's basically just like any other sponge, so it makes a good lather with soap, but that's about it. Pretty underwhelming and nothing special. I love this! I had read a few reviews where people said it broke out their skin, but I have not had that problem, in fact, the opposite if anything! I also read that it dries out quickly, so I have been making every effort to keep it from doing that. I've noticed that the very top dries out and never quite gains its former glory, but the rest of the sponge has been just fine. It's only been a couple of weeks, but so far I'm a fan!I did not buy this from Amazon, but rather straight from Julep, and this may be one of the best things I've ever bought for my face. My skin is so much brighter and softer and the little acne I do get, doesn't grow to much. Seriously, buy this. Your face will thank you. This would dry out my skin and leave flakesI was originally excited to try this product, it seemed unique and useful! Then I opened the package naturally, I took a whiff immediately after opening when I was trying to determine a scent, and I immediately got light headed due to the overall chemical scent. It doesnt smell like harsh chemicals but smells chemical for sure. My boyfriend tells me that this smells like urinal cakes, but I cant verify that. Not pleasant thought, thats for sure. It also is not exfoliating at all and dries up to a shrively rock when not being used. It honestly feels like a dish sponge on my face. Maybe I could see this for someone with sensitive skin who has a hard time with similar products but otherwise, it's a total miss for me. This sponge seemed kind of strange when it arrived.  It was a bit damp and musty but apparently it is supposed to be that way.  However, after getting it wet in the shower and using it over the last couple weeks, I have come to appreciate it.  I use it without cleanser, applying  my cleanser afterward.  I rub it over my face and it does provide gentle exfoliation without scratching or irritation.  It came with a suction cup and hook so I just hang it back up on the shower wall when I am done.  It dries up between showers but it is easy to rehydrate.  I can see how it it might be difficult to use with cleanser if you wanted to get the cleanser out afterward; I'm not sure how you could do it as you are not supposed to wring the sponge.  You would probably always have to use the same cleanser and just not worry about not getting it out.

So overall this is a a pretty neat exfoliation sponge and I am glad I tried it.  The packaging did say it would only last a month or two which is unfortunate.  Keep in mind that if you like this sponge, it will require frequent replacement which could get expensive. Totally over priced! It does absolutely nothing to exfoliate your skin.  Don't but into the hype.  It doesn't work.  It is hanging in my shower and I will most likely throw it out.  Useless!I have been well pleased with my Julep Konjac Sponge. While is smaller than I anticipated (a bit smaller than a bar of soap) it packs a powerful punch. It gently and efficiently exfoliates my face. Used in the morning it is perfect to use before I put on my makeup. Makeup seems to go on easier and look better. Using at night it refreshes my face and actually gives me a canvas for my night time face routine.
It was damp when I received it so I could use immediately. This sponge needs to hydrated before each use and rinsed out good when finished. It come with a handy suction hook.
My only disappointment was in needing to replaces after 30-60 days. I was recently told by a dermatologist not when it comes to treating rosacea, it's not a bad idea to occasionally give your skin a break and use only water to clean it.
Pretty counterintuitive, and certainly not an option if you are trying to remove makeup, but on those days when you have nothing on your skin but serum and moisturizer, this sponge is nothing short of fabulous.
Freshens and cleans without using any cleanser, much like micellar water does.
Julep has some of the best nail polishes around, and now I'm also sold on this sponge. I use this sponge in the shower with the Julep cleansing stick. It comes with a very handy suction cup hook which you can hang by the attached string. The sponge is a very gentle exfoliator and has a smooth gel like feel so can even be used without a lathering cleanser. I'm not really sure how I should rate this.

It smells weird, it feels like it's doing nothing for me, and I can't wring it out. How do I get my cleanser out of it? Just keep soaking it? I hang it to dry like the instructions say and it gets super hard which takes a while to reconstitute and moisten.

I just think the sponge is odd and weird. I'm going to use it for at least a month to see if I notice anything different on my face. I guess we will see. I don't feel any different after a week or so. The first time I opened my Julep box, I didn't know what to think about this squishy egg-shaped, slightly wet sponge. I was like what the heck I'll give it a whirl. It came in my box. Though I did have to google it to find out what do I do with this??? After using it for about a month, I started getting all types of compliments on my skin! I've never had a single compliment on my skin. I mean, I felt like my skin was starting to look more hydrated but you know it could've just been in my head. Even the ladies at the beauty counter now tell me how wonderful my skin looks. Buy this, and love it, and cherish it and it will love you back!I subscribe to Julep monthly and have seen this sponge offered in their boxes but never opted in. Well now I am a total believer! I keep in the shower and when I work my cleanser into my face I feel so much of a difference. The sponge came moist which was a little strange but I believe it's part of the ""Green-Tea"" bit..

I have been using now for a month- Love how great my face feels when using this sponge each morning with my daily cleaner. I will add to future Julep boxes in the future and you can get three great products each month below $22 for subscribing to their boxes ( no commitment needed month to month and you build points )I love the feel of this sponge on my face.  I used to use a Clarisonic but this has a nice feel to it and doesn't take as long for the clean skin feeling.  It left my skin feeling soft and refreshed.

I used it with my favorite NIA 24 cleanser. Julep Konjac Sponge
They are not kidding when they say this is super gentle.
I have the green tea colored sponge and have tried it a few times now.
So far not overly impressed with it.
It  comes in a plastic little pouch that helps to keep the sponge a bit damp.
Has a little plastic hook with a suction cup on it so you can just put right on the bathroom wall in order to hang it from.
It is so gentle that I am not so sure it is really doing anything for me.
I do not wear any make up at all and rarely use anything at all on my face other than Ivory soap.
With this sponge you can use some kind of cleaner with it or not.
I have tried it with both soap and not. It is gentle and feels fine when using it either way.
Weeks later and I am not noticing any difference with this sponge.
I just keep it on the bathroom wall. It has dried up and I had no issues at all just placing it is warm water and having it soften right back up.
Did not flake at all or break any of it off. I will keep using it to see if maybe after two months I notice anythingKonjac root sponges are known for their ability to exfoliate skin gently, which makes them ideal for daily facial exfoliation.  This little JULEP KONJAC SPONGE (with balancing green tea powder) is indeed very gentle on my sensitive skin.  Green tea powder is supposed to help acne and generally produce prettier, more radiant skin.  My skin didn't look very different after I used this sponge, but my face did feel clean and energized.

The sponge comes with a suction-cup hook that fastens to a mirror; the hook holds the sponge by its hanging cord to allow it to dry between uses.  The instructions say to replace the sponge every 1-2 months.  (Konjac sponges cannot be cleaned. )Great product! Really cleared up my skinWhat an amazing, soothing experience this sponge provides.  Unlike a regular loofa this sponge is softer yet more invigorating on the skin and creates a smoother, cleaner feel.

It absorbs the shower gel or soap of your choice and rinses clean with a nice hook for hanging to dry.  It also includes a suction cup to attach to your shower wall for hanging.

I have been a loofa user but switching over to this product going forwardI've been using this for about a week now and I'm not entirely convinced this is any better at exfoliation than a normal washcloth. This sponge is far too gentle. Not only did it not exfoliate my face, there were still traces of makeup left on my skin. I've tried it with my favorite cleanser and still needed wash my face after using a washcloth.

I swatched lipsticks on my arm and after a vigorous scrub with cleanser, they still remained.

I'm also not a fan of how this product is supposed to stay continuously damp. It specifically says to not wring it out, and that it shouldn't be dry. Seems like a breeding ground for bacteria. Its just okay for me.  The sponge arrived in a sealed package.  Smaller than I expected considering the price.  At its widest points the sponge is only 3 x 4 x 1.  The sponge is all natural.  When you open the package the sponge is moist.  I have used the sponge several times now.  I wet the sponge and massage my skin in a circular motion as the package said to use it. I cant really tell the sponge is exfoliating my skin.  Its not bad, its just okay.  The sponge does come with hook and string to hang the sponge in the shower.  Thats a nice touch. I am loving this Julep Konjac Sponge! I have sensitive skin, so the konjac is perfect. The texture is soft and squishy like a cake but it is very strong and because of all the small nooks and crannies it is able to grab up dirt and oil and dry skin from your face and wash it away. I found the konjac dried very quickly and was easy to clean after use.

The sponge is a gentle exfoliate and helps to refine pores. When you add the Green Tea that is antioxidant rich the sponge is a more efficient cleanser.

I love it comes with a string and suction cup to stick to the side of my shower. The size is pefect as it fits into the palm of my hand and coverage is great to clean my face. This little Julep Green Tea Konjac Sponge works miracle on my face.  I never thought this slippery sponge would do much, but after cleansing my face with it, it becomes unusually smooth.  It comes hydrated with a string for hanging, and a hook with a suction cup to hang it on the bathroom tie or mirror.

I recommend it. Feels really nice on my my face at night, and much cheaper (and more hygienic I think) than those Clarisonic face washers. This you can toss after awhile and start fresh, those you have to buy an expensive replacement head or try to hope the one you have is clean.

It doesn't feel too rough or too light just perfect. It has a loop to hang so it dries out well between uses.  Pleasant smell.

My serum and moisturizer seem to go on better with this done first (I use Vichy face wash milk first with this). FIRST IMPRESSIONS

Smaller than I expected, it is smaller than the smallest size bar of bath soap.  It comes wrapped in what is essentially the same as a plastic sandwich bag  not something I would consider giving as a gift. When I opened it the sponge was damp.  The manufacturer makes it clear with their packaging label that the soap is shipped hydrated (wet). They also make it very clear that it will dry out and get hard and to soften it again you should hydrate it, or other words get it wet.

The sponge is shipped with a tiny suction cup and plastic hook.  While the hook won't add anything to the attractiveness of your bath, it is simple and functional.

The first impression I had when I zipped open the baggie is that the sponge smelled like an old unclean drain.  It wasn't the kind of smell that gave me a strong desire to rub it against my face.

IN USE

AFTER washing the sponge thoroughly the unpleasant odor didn't linger and the sponge lost its disagreeable odor.  The first time I used it I didn't use any soap. I felt the sponge was too soft and non-abrasive to do an effective job at exfoliating (which means to gently scrub loose dry dead skin off).  When I used it again, this time as I normally would with facial soap, it really didn't feel much different from any other sponge intended for bath use, most of which cost $3-4 at the drug store.  I believe this product is overpriced at $12, especially because the manufacturer recommends replacing it every 30-60 days.  That is just too steep of a price to pay for a small sponge.

SUMMARY

If you wonder, as I did, what the words in the product name mean, heres the answer:

JULEP - Julep Beauty, Inc. is a privately held Seattle, WA based cosmetics company founded in 2007 by Jane Park, a former Starbucks and Boston Consulting Group executive.

GREEN TEA  refers to the color of the sponge. They also sell the same sponge in charcoal and clay colors.  Ms. Park does indicate that the sponge is infused with skin balancing green tea powder but does not list any ingredients at her website and her Amazon description conflicts by describing the ingredient as charcoal.

KONJAC  is a food product derived from roots considered in the Far East to have medicinal properties. It is also used as a vegan substitute for gelatin.

NOTE:  Julep is a direct marketing company (think Avon, Tupperware, Mary Kay, etc) that enlists Marketing Selling Specialists to host Maven Meetups throughout the country.  They are also known for several causes that support empowering women. The Julep Green Tea Konjac Sponge is a really nice way to cleanse.  I use it morning and night with my cleanser.  I first apply the cleanser to my face, then lightly scrub in a circular motion with the sponge.  It feels very soft and gentle, but leaves my skin smooth, clean, and exfoliated.  It feels much gentler than a wash cloth.

The sponge arrives already moistened.  Because I use it twice a day, it doesn't really have time to dry out.  I am careful to be gentle when rinsing the sponge out in order to make it last as long as possible.  It came with a little suction cup and hook for hanging in the shower or wherever you prefer to use it.  The green tea  in the sponge is supposed to help your skin with a boost of antioxidants.  I am not sure about that claim, but I do really like how it makes the most of my cleanser but is still very easy on my skin. I have the Julep Charcoal Konjac sponge and am addicted.  This is almost the exact same but a different color.  It's a really gentle exfoliation which is great for sensitive skin. I was hoping for a green tea scent or otherwise spa immersion experience but sadly there is none. This facial sponge feels awesome! It is the perfect texture to revitalize and smooth the face. The shape is perfect to get into areas around the nose and eyes and chin. Each side of this little sponge has a different texture, so you can decide which you prefer. This sponge turns any common facial cleanser into a skin refining treatment. You don't even need to use a cleanser with the sponge, as it is infused with green tea and is, therefore, antioxidant rich. I no longer have to buy an exfoliating scrub. This sponge gently removes dead skin cells and invigorates the production of new cells. The handy little suction hanger is useful for hanging it in the shower between uses. Wow I had not used anything like this before. My skin is super sensitive but this small sponge is really really special. Exfoliated by skin in a very gentle manner and made my face feel really refreshed and ready to apply shea butter or another moisturizer and other treatments. I  am really sold on this and recommend it highly. This time of year it would make a great stocking stuffer. I am sold. This sponge comes packaged like it is moist.  But I don't think it is wet.  It is the texture of the sponge - like a proper sponge cake.  It's kind of odd.  But it does do a heck of a job exfoliating.  You get it wet, squeeze it and just the lightest touch of a lather seems to appear briefly.  It makes your skin totally ready to absorb facial products.  My moisturizer went right on and right in like I've never had it work so well or fast before.

It's a bit smaller than I would have thought from the picture of the girl's hand squeezing it out - either that or I have serious man hands...

There is no noticeable smell.  I was kind of hoping for a jasmine green tea vibe, but I think most people these days prefer no scents.

There is a tiny suction cup with a J hook in the package - to hang your sponge when you are done so it can dry (or whatever it does) in the shower.

I liked it a lot but it is a bit odd to get used to.  I am sure with using it more, I will adapt. I purchased this item from a local Ulta Beauty, and I must say that I am totally in love!
The sponge is naturally antibacterial being that is infused and made with charcoal, while also being an amazing skin purifying agent.
The sponge with come with the ""suction cup"" hanger which I placed in the shower where the water stream will not hit when it's not in use to allow for a compete dry out. Keep in mind, I was sceptic about it just continuously falling down like most hangers of that type do however it's been a month now and it hasn't fallen yet.
With this sponge I really enjoy the amount of lather that this sponge allows when I am using a pre cleanse or a cleansing facial product.
It's also a very decently sized sponge, I've had several where you feel like it's to thin or flimsy this item isn't at all.
So I wouldn't think twice about getting another one!My face feels so clean and smooth after using this sponge!Not really sure if I see a difference in my skin. I've been using this sponge for 4-5 months now with the Bare Face oil. Fell apart very quickly, pretty much useless a week and a half in. These are very small and I do not feel like I get much use out of these. I will stick to the bar or liquid soap. These are packaged nicely. The suction cup is nice and works well. Makes my skin ever so soft!I'm not sure if I used it wrong, but after my second use, the sponge shrunk and became hard and looked unappealing. Not something I want to use to wash my face :/It broke me out at first, but then cleared my blackheads. But then it broke me out again. Use every few days as directed. Not everyday. I like it but I don't understand the hype. Okay but you can find cheaper at local CVSPerfect- just what I was looking forI'm not brand-loyal when it come stop konjac sponges, I just buy the cheapest ones that I can find.  The standard price for this konjac sponge is way more than I normally pay, but I happily bought one during the Prime Day sale.  Since it arrived, however, I can't bring myself to use it.  Here's why...

The sponge arrived damp and well sealed in a plastic wrapper.  Other brands do this, so I wasn't surprised to see it packaged this way.  However, when I took the sponge out of the wrapper, it has a strong, alcohol-like chemical smell.  I'm not sure if it's treated with alcohol, a fungicide, or some sort of preservation chemicals, but it was clear from the smell that it wasn't just hydrated with water.

I was still willing to use the sponge, assuming that I could just wash the sponge with soap and water and have the chemical smell (and whatever residue might be on the sponge) disappear.  However, after washing it over 5 times with various facial cleansers, it still smells slightly of chemicals and has a slightly oily feel to it.  It's enough to put me off of using it. Great for deep facial cleaning. Easy to use and easy to clean as well. Appreciate the provided took too!Great cleanser and exfoliator; leaves skin soft and smooth. I was skeptical at first but I have fallen in love with this sponge and never looked back! This is the only konjac sponge I've ever owned so I can't say much about it in comparison to others, however compared to using a wash cloth, it makes a world of a difference! My skin feels so much cleaner and I love that it comes with a string and suction cup so it can hang to dry. These Julep sponge is fabulous.  I recently started using them but I noticed a significant difference in the feel of my skin within the first week.  It's a little more expensive than other brands but it's well worth the additional cost. shipment was good. I love this sponge, I don't know how I lived without it. Wash rags are too harsh for daily use, and my makeup was ruining them anyway. This sponge provides a deep cleans without stripping away my natural oils, and saves my wash rags to be used for a light drying action. I can see why these are so popular. They feel kinda squishy, and they dry out by hanging it from the plastic suction hanger it comes with. It re-hydrates in seconds next time you use it. I plan to replace it every 3 months. I seriously don't know how I lived without these sponges. It's like getting a facial every single day, seriously. They are so soft yet I feel like I can see a visible difference in my skins texture after I use it. I love using it with the Julep cleansing oil, but even with other cleansers it still leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Love this easy to use, perfectly-sized, and easy to stow sponge!  My skin is sensitive and this gently exfoliates without causing irritation.  I love the glow I get with each use.  Very, very worth adding to a skin-care regimen.  Also love that it happily hangs with it's own suction cup!Does The Job. Really adore this exfoliator! You can use it with or without soap and just clean by circular motion. It leaves my skin super soft. And I especially love the pleasant natural scent. The sponge is disposable after 2 month use. Love love love it! Cleans my skin and leaves it silky smooth!Fantastic!!! Dries out reallllllly quick. A couple days without being wet and it's done. Keep it moist!!!This is the greatest thing ever! My face feels so much cleaner than just using my fingers. The little string is genius to keep it from sitting in a damp puddle. Best facial product Ive bought in a long time and totally natural!!!My daughter was very pleased with this product when cleaning her face each day. I love this sponge. Someone recommended it to me, and I almost ignored them because I don't typically use sponges for cleansing. Im so glad I have it a try. Ive been using it for a week and love the way my skin looks and feels. Very pleased with this product! It's a great exfoliator for my super sensitive skin!This is a great product. I use this with my bare face oil or the bare face stick. It does come wet so don't be surprised about that. I keep mine in the shower ready to use at the end of the day to take off all my make up. I find mine lasts about 3 months with daily use. Not good for make up removingThese are the best Konjac sponges!! don't waste your money on any other ones, these are well worth the couple extra bucks :)This konjac sponge is my secret weapon for keeping my skin soft and exfoliated when Im traveling. Its a very gentle exfoliant, so if you have sensitive skin that usually doesnt take well to physical exfoliation this is absolutely worth a try. After I use it, my skin looks calm, feels clean, and is ready for the rest of my skincare regimen. Bonus for exfoliation: a smooth canvas for makeup application!I ordered two of the green sponges, (I had used another brand but its no longer available on Amazon) .  Of the two I received, they are not the same size when taking out of the package. The first one I opened was much smaller than the one Im used to - a small travel size. The 2nd one I opened was of a normal size. Not sure why there is such a noticeable difference in size.  I really love the green tea konjac sponge & will check out a different brand next time.

I was first exposed to it in my salon when I was treating myself to a facial. My esthetician highly recommended it and gave me a free sample. I was hooked. It both exfoliates and calms the skin. It doesn't leave my skin feeling raw or red. I highly recommend it. I've been using this product for over a year now and I absolutely love it. No more little breakouts. It safely cleans and exfoliates without drying or causing other damage. It has a nice scent and using just a little bit goes a long way. I have used this cleanser several years twice a day.  My esthetician recommended it. I had been prone to breakouts and redness, and I had sun damage.  This cleanser cleared everything up without drying my skin.  I love it!!  I am 52. In my third month of pregnancy, my face started to break out badly.  My forehead looked like I had poison ivy and it was bad enough that a foundation primer and full-coverage foundation couldn't hide it.  I couldn't use anything containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, and my regular facewash (some Clinique one) wasn't doing anything.  My esthetician recommended this twice a day to start off and then when my face started to improve, once a day.  After three of four days, I saw slight improvement in the texture of my skin.  After about two weeks, I saw significant improvement--my makeup went on smoother, certain patches went away, and the overall redness improved.  I've been continually using this once a day and exfoliating once a week, and my skin looks better than it ever has.  I don't even use foundation anymore!  I think it took about a month to get to that point.

It's a little pricey for a facewash, but well worth a try.  The peppermint in it doesn't sting, either, unless you have an open cut.  I have sensitive skin, but this didn't have any adverse effects on me.  It's a little drying, particularly if you're using it once a day, so just make sure to wear a light moisturizer. I am 40 years old and have had oily, acne skin with large pores for over 15 years.  I have tried almost everything including peels, lasers, micro-derm-abrasion, & products.  Cosmedix is absolutely wonderful.  It cleans my face, removes oils and calms the redness.  I started with the purify face wash and purify toner.  They worked so well I added moisturizers, affirm, clarity, defy, & clear.  I used the Purity Clean cleanser, Purity Balance toner and phytoclear for 1 week and had unbelievable results.  Then I added the affirm, clarity & clear.  In 1 night, the pores on my nose almost all disappeared. I will add define next week.

I think that once my acne redness completely heals I will get the purity peel.

I will say that I am not impressed the opti-crystals eye cream.  Just not doing anything for me after 2 weeks of use.  I have very sensitive eyes. Love this product and the entire cosmedix line. The only problem I have had is keeping this item in stock at my home. Also, it is difficult to find, but have found it in stock at dermstore. com. They have excellent service and offer the entire line of products which I would recommend for someone with acne/oily, or combination skin. I ordered the product line from Amazon and there was a bit of a problem with avaliability of these items, so i would suggest to order these products from dermstore or another source that keeps a continual stock. I would highly recommend this product in exfoliating the skin and keeping it in balance. I would also suggest the regular use of clarity serum,  the balance toner, as well as refine or define for oily skin. This is the only line that has worked for my skin care needs and is not harsh or irriating. Cosmedix uses all natural ingredients and there are no parabens or sulfates, but just active ingredients that are good for your skin.  Results will be seen within a few days. Bottom line: TRY IT. So. I discovered this product after spending the night with my bf at one of his family member's houses. I got permission to use whatever I needed. Never seen it before in my life. I thought meh- it's a cleanser comme ci, comme a. I used it maybe twice? Even those TWO times the improvement was drastic. It was unbelievable. It was fantasamacious. That is not a word, but I am okay with that. I have blackheads on my nose. BAM! They started to dissapear.

I haven't gotten this in the mail yet, but I can't wait until I do!Wonderful cleanser for my children who have acne.  They love it!This was recommended to me by my Dermatologist. I was skeptical that it would be a good cleanser and not drying because it has lactic acid in it. I was not only pleasantly surprised - this cleanser has changed my skin! I used to get blackheads and was prone to breakouts. Because of this cleanser,  I no longer have clogged pores. It is minty and fresh and leaves your skin tingling. I will never do without this cleanser! I highly recommend it!Great product. Arrived quickly. Was hoping it'd do more for acne BUT its a mild nice cleanser and it feels kinda mintyI use this CosMedix Cleanser every morning and evening.  It's cooling & soothing without stripping my skin.  Very good product. Using this for a while, great product. Love this face wash!  It does everything it claims to.  I have ordered it many times and will continue to do so. This product did not really clear up my acne or provide any obvious benefits. I like the smell, and it does leave my skin feeling refreshed. But I had to stop using it so I could switch to something that worked better for me. Holy grail facewash. I use this with another exfoliator with beads, my skin is so soft and clear. Smells dreamy and expensive. This was first sold to me by my facialist but she does not carry the full size bottle. This one lasts me 3-4 months. I love this cleanser! Although it may be too drying to use with other exfoliating products, so I like to rotate it with CosMedix Benefit Clean.  This cleanser though is my favorite and can be used as a mask too!great productI use this at night and an off brand salycic face wash in the morning and seems to be working very well for meI've been using this product since I was 24. I'm 38 ya'll! Every time I buy a different product to try to save money or because I can't run out to Walmart and buy CosMedix, I regret the decision. I've gotten so used to the refreshing feeling and smooth skin I get with this product. After reading so many positive reviews for this product, I was excited to try it. Unfortunately after using it faithfully for several weeks, I haven't noticed any improvement in my skin. If anything, it has caused my acne to flare up even more. Didn't help my skin almost whatsoever. Although it feels a bit minty, and i enjoyed that aspect of it. I have adult acne prone skin and this did not improve the problem. Since starting to use it I've developed more painful large blemishes that I rarely had before. It also didn't give you that clean feeling after use and doesn't really foam up even with a cleansing brush or pad. I gave it three weeks hoping it would improve things and still hated it. I was very happy with this purchase. I use this cleanser in combination with the LUSH herbalism, ocean salt, vanishing cream, and grease lightning. The all natural products from LUSH are great but I feel this cleanser really puts the icing on the cake for my skincare routine. After only about 5 days of use I'm noticing my acne scars are fading and the white heads I would always get around my nose area causing inflammation are also clearing up. As a disclaimer I think the product caused a purge of some sorts because I got some new whiteheads the first few days of using it, but they were really small and cleared up quickly. Too chemically for me.  I thought this particular brand was more natural.  This cleanser looks like the old Prell shampoo to me and doesn't smell good.  Unfortunately, I just had to throw it away. Love all the products from this line!Eh, it's OK. Nothing special in my opinion and it's expensive. Will probably never buy again. Love this face wash. My skin feels very clean but not dried out. Doesn't workPretty decent cleanser.  Nothing special tho. I bought a few products from this brand and my face has never looked better.  They did help with fine lines and eliminated my breakouts.  Don't know how to differentiate from which of their products did what, but will certainly keep going with them all.  I use this product, the serum and the hydrating spray.  (the spray I have used for a year now and is what inspired me to give the other products a try)Love this product. This is great face wash. I use it in combination with the clarity serum, and they have significantly reduced my hormornal acneBeen using Cosmedix since 2008 and just love the purity clean exfoliating cleanser.  It's amazing on the skin and helped cleared up my acned within 24 hours.  Amazing product!! Highly recommend this brand and this product!! It never disappoints. This cleanser dried out my skin. the morning after i washed it, my face was broke out and peeling everywhere. I looked liked I had a rash. My skin is sensitive and already dry, but when i use this wash my face gets worse. It also tightens my face, making it feel dirty and hard. I would defiantly reconsider using this product if your skin is sensitive. Awesome deal on a great product! Same as if I'd buy it from the day spa! Same quality better deal!Best face wash for my oily, blackhead-prone skin.  Helps keep my skin clear better than any other face wash I've tried (as a former product junkie, this says a lot). The reason I bought this product was someone's comment saying this is the right product is you have combination skin. More specifically, if you have a oily T zone and dry cheeks and occasionally breakouts- this is PERFECT! I have never loved a another skin product more and believe me when I've tried close to anything!-I purchased this product a while back and I have to say it did nothing to improve my acne. In face I think it just dried my skin out.
Oh well.

2 stars for at least cleaning my face :)It literally starts clearing up my skin over night. I know it's a bit pricey, but it is worth it. I went about a month without using CosMedix products and my face started breaking out again. I started using it this week and my face is already clearing up. GREAT PRODUCT!!!I've used Purity Clean since the dermatologist I worked for 8 years ago recommended it. I haven't found anything else that even comes close to providing the same type of clean and leaves my skin glowing. Love this product. The pores on my face have become smaller and my ccomplexion has definitely improved.  Myface is so clean after use. Will definitely buy again. I use it every night. You only need to use a small amount to cleanse. Love it! Love it! Love it!About four months ago, I had my first outbreak of cystic acne ever- all over my cheeks and chin. I tried several products, watched my diet, slept on clean pillowcases, etc- nothing seemed to work. The woman who runs a salon I visited gave me a sample of this about a month before my breakout occurred. After trying all the methods I knew, I found the sample and in just one use, I saw an improvement in softness and redness. I immediately bought this and the Clarity serum (which advertises that its AHAs will fade acne scarring), and have been using them faithfully for nearly a month now. I have seen such an improvement in the acne- no new breakouts besides an occasional blemish that will go away in a couple days of using both products. These products have been the only method that has worked so consistently for me, and I'm hoping the serum will fade the scars in the near future. I'm being patient about that because there are four months' worth of scars to heal. I hope that anyone else who struggles from cystic acne will give this product a try- it's worth the money!On my second bottle of this stuff and I will never use another product again. It keeps my face blemish free without over drying. I have normal to combination skin and have found that it is the best thing for me. I am 27 and have had acne on my cheeks, forehead, chin, nose area, etc. for as long as I can remember.  I tried Retin-A, Pro-Active, all natural products, drugstore products, department store products, you name it!  Nothing ever seemed to help my oily skin, clogged pores, and never-ending breakouts.  10+ years of picking at my skin has left me with bad scarring as well.  I am so so so thankful my coworker told me about this face wash!  I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin looks AMAZING!  It's baby soft, my breakouts are gone, my pores are invisible, and I can tell it is starting to slowly take care of my scarring.  I have never had results like this with anything I've tried, EVER.  If you're wondering about whether to buy this, BUY IT.  Use it every morning in the shower, and wash your face with this and a hot wash cloth when you get home in the evening.  Leave it on a bit longer for a more exfoliating mask.  It works wonders!  I sound like an infomercial but honestly, you won't be sorry you tried this!I am very happy with this product.  I have oily skin and my other cosmedix products go on really well after using  this cleanser.  Cosmedix is a bit pricey, but you only need a small amount, a pea size portion will do the job, so it does last awhile.  I generally get compliments on my complexion when I use cosmedix, and that is a good indicator that I'm using the correct products. been using this product for a couple years and is by far the best cleanser I have come across in the past decade. This line of products, CosMedix has been recommended by my dermatologist. This is a great facial cleanser, not drying. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the fragrance. It is not horrible, but not fabulous either. I would certainly purchase this again. I use this product all the time.  Decided to buy it off amazon because my local store was closed and it was a bit cheaper.  Not sure I'll do this again.  The formula feels and smells different.  It almost leaves a soapy film on my face.  When I looked on the back of the packaging, it says it was made in Canada, while all the previous bottle was manufactured in the US.  Not sure if that's the difference or not, but I probably will not be ordering it online anymore. Exfoliates and deep cleans, tightens skin pores for a healthier skin. Highly recommend this product. Lasts at least 3 months with daily use. Hands down this is my favorite cleanser in the world! I'm a skin care professional I've tried thousands of different cleansers and everytime I come back to this one. This is a great exfoliator, however it doesn't remove makeup. You can use the benefit gentle cleanser and then this product. I have used this product for 6 years after my facial person recommended it.  She no longer carries this and has tried to switch me to something else.  No way!  Best price is on Amazon. I was about to order this product off of another website where they sell a lot of cosmedix products but found it for cheaper on amazon. I was excited to try this cleanser out to help with my acne prone skin. Before using this cleanser I had about 3 small pimples on my face and a few acne scars. 4 days after cleansing with this, I broke out with 5 new pimples and my skin tone looks really bad. All of the reviews I have read (and that includes over 100 reviews) of this cleanser was positive. People that have used this said that it had a nice fragrance that included peppermint and fresh scent. However, the product I received did not have that smell.. instead the first time I used it the smell was very off putting. I can't put my finger on it but it is quite strong and does not smell 'nice' or pepperminty what so ever. If I had to describe it, it would be a sour, bad breath smell to it. I do smell some peppermint but it's not the usual sweet smelling scent.

So I am suspecting that this cleanser is either expired, or a cheap imitation of the real deal. That is why it's cheaper than other sites. If anyone can explain to me why the smell of the cleanser I received is so offputting and not the same as everyone else... I'd appreciate it. I have been using this cleanser for 6 years and love it.  I am 53 and get compliments on my skin all the time.  Very gentle exfoliation.  Non drying.  Keeps breakouts at bay.  I don't have to wear much makeup!The product was delivered on time and I love it.  Much cheaper than buying it at a salon. I wish that I could have bought the larger size.  I actually bought two, one for me and the other for a friend.  I love this line of products and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great face wash.  Thank you Cosmedix!!I have been using this face wash for the past year, after an aesthetician suggested it for my oily skin. I have T-zone issue and struggle to keep my face clear. I use this cleanser twice a day. I apply without water and then use a wet washcloth to take it off. It keeps my skin clear and doesn't dry me out too badly. One bottle should last about 8-10 weeks. I had really bad hormonal cystic acne, which doesn't clear up with anything. However, this product definitely worked with my smaller, oily zits. Love this cleanser. Make face feel really clean. Not oily or drying. This was my absolute go-to exfoliating product for years. I used to apply as a mask, and it acted as a gentle peel. My skin would glow! The last two bottles I've gotten were simply not the same product. The first one I bought online and it was so different that I thought it was bunk. I threw it away. Then I went to my usual salon and got another bottle--but same thing. I left it on longer tonight wondering if the formula was weaker---huge mistake!!!! My skin feels so irritated now and looks horrible! Whatever they've done, they've ruined this product. Total shame.

Update: a day later and my skin everywhere it touched is dry, raw, stinging and breaking out in a painful red rash. There is nothing about the new formula that is remotely the same as the old formula. It's different stuff in the same bottle. The old purity clean ever so gently buffed my skin and left it soft, healthy and glowing. This new stuff has zero exfoliating powers and is extremely irritating.

I'm disgusted that they would try to pass this off as the product we knew and loved, and I'm angry that my skin is literally burned because they switched out quality ingredients for dangerous junk. Nice work Cosmedix--you've permanently lost a devoted customer today. Great stuff. The bottle was different. Even the product felt a little different. The consistency was less thick. I started breaking out a little the first week. I'miss going to use it until it's all gone and hopefully I'll be able to follow up with a better review. It works good like the way it clears my skin ,,The product I received is not the same product as advertised. this is garbage, it did nothing but ruin my face for the longest time. If you're having acne problems don't just buy whatever looks popular on instagram. Go to a dermatologist and see what they recommend, it was a while before i realized this stuff was casuing more harm than good. Im going to copy and paste this exact review for the other cosmedix products i purchased, they were all horrible and damaged my skin badlyUnfortunately, the manufacturer has changed the formula of this and other products. Reviewers who say it smells and feels different are correct. Not the same product at all. I've tried contacting Cosmedix and have not received a response. I've loved this line for years, but will no longer use it. A real shame.

May repurchase ... see how it goes. I live in the semi-arid state of Colorado and I have extremely sensitive skin from prior years of Retin-a use.
My skin reacts to the slightest thing therefore I am super skeptical of any products claiming to be for sensitive skin.
This one cleans well without stripping, but it did cause a burning, stinging reaction after a couple of days worth of use.
I do not doubt this would be good for some, but for me, it wasn't.
I have since switched over to Jurlique's Brightening line and I have had much better results. Fab cleanser. Great for sensitive, dry or aging skin. Doesn't strip but gets the skin very clean. Personally,  I would recommend a separate make up remover. i buy it when the price cut off. it makes my face fresh and clean. i will buy it againThis is the best facial cleansing cream there is! Smells heavenly, works gently but thoroughly. Little bit goes a long way. Would definitely recommend. Just a small amount of this cleanser works.  My skin (dry, age 47) still feels great and it gets rid of the dirt and make-up of the day.  I love Jurlique!Clearer skin. From the first time I used this product and every time sense my skin has felt protected and nourished. The Jurlique Products do what they say and really balance your skin. For all the natural skin care products I've tried this is a first. Try the Herbal Recovery Gel, it has minimized my fine lines and toned my skin. Saw a difference in my skin after a couple of weeks and saw a big difference after a couple of months being on the full system!Okay but too flowery for me. I love this face wash! It smells great and is light and gets the job done. I use it with my clarisonic face washer almost every night. It doesn't dry out my face too much - in fact I think it's just the hard water in our apartment that does that so that is of no deduction to the rating of the product itself.

The only thing I don't like about it is it does cause eye irritation when even just a little gets into your eye. I used to wash my face (with my clarisonic) looking into the mirror (which I understand isn't really normal if you think about it) but now I have to wash my face face down and squeeze my eyes shut (even if they're shut willy nilly I can still get soap in my eye and it will cause irritation). Great foaming cleanser... gets more of my makeup off than most face washes. I love the clean smell and the fact that you just need a drop because it foams so well... a little goes a long way. I've used jurlique products since the 90s. I do love their products as I have extremely sensitive skin and eyes. I've always used the soothing foaming cleanser, but decided to give this a try. Wasn't a huge fan. The texture of the product is very different from what I am used to. Felt like more of a makeup remover than an actual cleanser. Didn't feel it cleanses my skin as well. I've been using this product for about 4 years now and absolutely love it.  It never dries out my skin (I live in a desert),  keeps it relatively free of blackheads,  and each bottle lasts me for at least 6 months.  Well worth it. have been using for years.  light and perfect.  Just wish they still made in the Rose scent but ?Best thing you can do before you go to bed at night. I have been through many other cleansers - probably top 10 best selling from amazon, sephora, and beauty. com. This one is it. My favorite cleanser used to be Fresh, but the company stopped making the rose cleanser (I like the tube one, now it's in a foaming bottle).

It washes your make up well without being and smelling harsh - in fact, the smell is wonderful! I have sensitive skin, so its gentleness is great on my face. I was really pleased when I saw that it removed my waterproof eyeliner which I wear everyday.

Great product, definitely will be repurchasing. And the price!!!!

Good Buy!Nice foam. I treat myself to a facial a few times a year and over the past couple of years the word ""dehydrated"" kept coming up in regards to my skin (from more than 1 person).  This last aesthetician said your average store bought cleansers are too harsh for your skin starting in your 20's.  Well, if that was the case, I was far behind since I am 40.  The more I thought about it, she was right, I was still treating my skin like a teenager.  She recommended a cleanser and I wasn't overly impressed with the reviews.  I had already starting using Jurlique night cream and serum about a year before, so I figured I would try this cleanser since I really do like the Jurlique.  It cost more than I ever thought I would buy on something you essentially wash down the drain, but I like it.  You don't need a lot of it, just a small pump is plenty so I think it will last awhile.  However, if you wear makeup everyday - I don't anymore - you will need a little more to get the makeup off.  I usually wash twice when I do wear makeup and it has removed it well.  It has a pleasant scent and I feel like it leaves my face soft, not stripped.  I follow with the Thayers Witch Hazel and Cucumber toner, then a serum (I have used the Jurlique advanced serum and others) and then the Jurlique Herbal Recovery night cream and eye cream.  My skin looks better, and the best part is no breakouts from these products. Been using the Jurlique cleanser for a few years. Doesn't feel dry after washing. Skin doesn't dry out with thisPersonally I really am a fan of this cleaner it leaves my mature skin soft doesn't dry it out. I have been using this for years I would recommend try itThis Jurlique cleanser is SO gentle, even on my sensitive skin.  It smells delicious!!! Doesn't take much to do the job and it cleans every bit of makeup/dirt off your face leaving it feeling gentle, smooth and pampered. The cleanser keeps my face smooth. I have a lot of redness from rosacea and it calms it down. Great smell too!For me- I am not a fan- broke me out and I don't care for the fragrance. My favorite face cleanser EVER!I was using the Balancing foam cleanser for a decade and switched to this as my skin needs have changed.  Replenishing foam cleanser is exactly what I needed!Just okay. Leaves a bit of a residue feeling afterward that isn't pleasant but not horrible, I guess. The smell is more chemical than rose which was very disappointing as the rose ingredient is half the reason I purchased it. I have dry skin but prone to breakouts, and this cleanser definitely didn't help with breakouts (it's not meant to, but thought I'd add it if anyone's skin type matches my own who's considering the purchase). End result: it now sits half full in my bathroom to look cute and I use other face washes. Positives are: the bottle is feminine and pretty, and it didn't overly dry my skin out. Great!","['Seems to work well on my dry-normal mature skin.', 'Light pleasant scent ^^\nMay repurchase ... see how it goes.', 'I live in the semi-arid state of Colorado and I have extremely sensitive skin from prior years of Retin-a use.', 'My skin reacts to the slightest thing therefore I am super skeptical of any products claiming to be for sensitive skin.', 'This one cleans well without stripping, but it did cause a burning, stinging reaction after a couple of days worth of use.', ""I do not doubt this would be good for some, but for me, it wasn't."", ""I have since switched over to Jurlique's Brightening line and I have had much better results."", 'Fab cleanser.', 'Great for sensitive, dry or aging skin.', ""Doesn't strip but gets the skin very clean."", 'Personally,  I would recommend a separate make up remover.', 'i buy it when the price cut off.', 'it makes my face fresh and clean.', 'i will buy it againThis is the best facial cleansing cream there is!', 'Smells heavenly, works gently but thoroughly.', 'Little bit goes a long way.', 'Would definitely recommend.', 'Just a small amount of this cleanser works.', 'My skin (dry, age 47) still feels great and it gets rid of the dirt and make-up of the day.', 'I love Jurlique!Clearer skin.', 'From the first time I used this product and every time sense my skin has felt protected and nourished.', 'The Jurlique Products do what they say and really balance your skin.', ""For all the natural skin care products I've tried this is a first."", 'Try the Herbal Recovery Gel, it has minimized my fine lines and toned my skin.', 'Saw a difference in my skin after a couple of weeks and saw a big difference after a couple of months being on the full system!Okay but too flowery for me.', 'I love this face wash!', 'It smells great and is light and gets the job done.', 'I use it with my clarisonic face washer almost every night.', ""It doesn't dry out my face too much -

Been using for many years!love this cream! it is the bestNot what I wanted, too strong smelling, W/O the smell I think this would be a good product. The product quality is the same, good as always,  the problem is that It took nearly two months to receive this product!I have very sensitive and dry skin all my life and cannot use most products to cleanse with exception of this product. Washes off dirt and makeup gently, no smells/perfumes. Love. Iam a loyal fan of Rene Guinot, having used it's products and had Guinot Cathiodermie facials forever, 30 years!
I alternate using this cleanser with using my clarisonic and Clinique mild facial soap - best of both worlds, wonderful very effective creamy soft cleanser and then when I feel I want a good scrub I use the clarisonic.
This cleanser will leave your skin clean, soft and relaxed. A little goes a long way, this bottle size lasts me about 3 months. I like all the Guinot Sensitive Line products and I have used them for years.  I cannot purchase them in stores in my area, so I am glad you carry them on-line.  They are worth the price!It is difficult to find a facial cleanser that removes your eye make up and does not irratate your eyes. This cleanser is excellent for sensitive skin, and leaves your skin feeling dewey and moisturized. I noticed that it is becoming more and more difficult to find. Hope Guinot is not going to discontinue it. I have fair, sensitive skin and this never burns or turns my face red after I cleanse. It also doesn't seem to upset the PH of my combination skin so I don't get excessive oil or breakouts. I've used it for over a year now. My only complaint is that no matter what I use to apply it witha washcloth, a cotton ball, a cotton padit doesn't seem to go very far. I use it twice per day and seem to buy a new bottle every month. Most products are very harsh on my skin making it more oily. Guinot is very gentle so I can use it twice a day without drying out on skin. I would recommend it to people with sensitive  combination skin.

You just mix it with water and wash. The process is fairly quick. It washes away easily. Ive used it alone and with a toner and moisturizer. Of course, its less drying when used with a moisturizer, but I didn't find it drying. I enjoyed using it.

I thought the scent was light and it smelled slightly familiar. I haven't been able to peg exactly what it reminds of though. This works well and getting the make up off, without drying out the skin.  I definitely like the way it feels when I use it. My first impression of the MEG 21 Cleanser was a good one. I really love the packaging. Not only did the bottle have a clear wrapper on it but it also had a small cap over the lid to keep the content from spilling out. The bottle is simple and classy and the pump is hygienic. I had never heard of the brand so decided to check it out. I was excited by what I read. The MEG 21 product line was started by Dr. Annette Tobia who has a PH. D in molecular biology along with a law degree.

While working on diabetes treatments, Tobia discovered that a drug being tested could slow down the aging process. They were able to formulate products that delivered this substance externally in the MEG 21 products. There are several products in the line with more to be added. The active ingredients are intended to target inflammation, glycation and oxidative stress. The product claims to reverse signs of visible aging within a few short weeks.

I looked up Ms. Tobia and she has pretty skin which was another check for the product. I washed my face with the product and it worked nicely. My skin felt soft and clean after.

So far so good. I will have to give it time to see if my skin shows appreciable results but according to the descriptions I read on the product I should see less lines, wrinkles and a clearer tone within two weeks and even better results at four. The cleanser is not cheap but if it works it is well worth the price.

My one negative so far on the product is the fragrance. It has a strong scent in my opinion and I don't like applying fragrance (nor do I see the need) to my face. I would not buy it for that reason alone but if it does deliver what it promises - younger looking skin I can look past it. I will see how my skin is looking in a few weeks. I have used this cleanser a few days now and I don't think its anything special. I mean it cleans my face and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean, but not sure I'd pay $23 a bottle. I will say it is a big bottle and since you only need a little bit, it will probably last a long time, but I don't know how long yet. It is a smooth cleaner, no scratchy beads in it. This would probably be great for those with sensitive skin as well since it seems gentle and simple. It has a light, clean scent. Customarily, I only cleanse my face at night - removing my make-up with a cleansing oil (Shu Uemura, mostly) followed by exfoliation.  In the morning, I tend to just hit my face with a few splashes of hot water and give it a good buff with the towel.  Since I didn't want to alter my evening routine (a modified version of the Korean ten-step beauty regimen), I opted to use this cleanser each morning.

It has a very thin, slippery consistency that feels nice on the skin.  The aroma is surprisingly pungent.  The ingredient list includes several citrus oils (orange, lemon and tangerine) as well as rosemary oil, but the scent itself most reminds me of one of those cult 1970's fragrances (like Robert Piguet's Fracas or Guerlain's Jicky) - yes, it's that potent.  Personally, I liked it, as I tend to prefer perfumed skincare to ""unscented"" which just smells like a bunch of chemicals, to me.  But if you don't like heavy fragrance, this is definitely NOT for you.

In terms of efficacy, while I can't vouch for the label's seemingly outrageous claim that it contains an amino acid that ""inactivates toxic sugars,""  I can say that my face felt very soft all day and, after a week, my skin is moist and clear-looking.  It's certainly a vast improvement over water alone.

Overall, a nice product that seems to have a positive impact on skin tone and texture. First, I love the name! It's personalized!

This is very gentle with no distinct smell to it (always good).  A soft lotion going on, my skin doesn't feel tight after.  Very gentle.

I don't have acne so I'm not sure if that's what this is for, maybe my son will share it with me. But so far, it looks good on the counter and feels great on my skin. I loved how my skin felt after I used this cleanser... soft and clean.  There is no scent I could detect.  There is a clear plastic cap over the spout, so don't stand there pressing the top waiting for the cleanser to come out... hehe... not one of my smarter moments.
I wish I could bath in this gentle cleaner!We both have been using the Meg 21 Cleanser prior to sleep and its been amazing. The cleanser is easy on and easy off. Leaves no residue and our skin feels silky smooth. There is no lasting fragrance and the overall verdict is that its a hit. Very good daily cleanser! Not only does this moisturizing wash leave skin feeling refreshed, clean, and moisturized, it has a nice and not overpowering scent that's gender-neutral. Will be using on a daily basis and buying more when I run out. I'm allergic to basically everything, so I'm always really hesitant to try new products.  I also have noticed that I continue to develop new allergies as I get older or have a child.  I also greatly dislike the feeling of lotion on my skin.  My husband can chase me around the room with lotion on his hands and I will run screaming.  This is how much I dislike that feeling.  I complain far more than my children about having to put on sunscreen.  Anyways, because I'm allergic to everything and I don't like lotion, I have to find cleansers that are super moisturizing so that I can wash with them and not add anything on afterwards.  I started with a small spot below my chin to make sure that I wasn't allergic to this.  So far so good, I have not had any hives or itchy places.  This leads me to believe that it will most likely be good for people who have very sensitive skin.  Secondly, this is more lotion than cleanser.  It is a thick cream that you use with water (so probably in the shower) and it both cleans and leaves your face super moist.  I don't add anything on top of it, so it makes me very happy.  My face also feels very soft and doesn't have any flaky bits around my forehead, which is often the most dry part of my face.  It doesn't do the tingly thing that most cleansers that have anti aging properties do, so I can't speak to if that is working or not.  All I can tell you is that is cleans and moisturizes at the same time, which is seriously what I want it to do. Light, mild cleanser that leaves no filmy residue.  Very nice product. I've used  many different types of moisturizers. This one is really good. It's not at all oily or creamy but leaves my face with a nice, refreshed feeling, and smooths my skin right away. It's odorless and easy to use and it does get skin clean. I didn't test with a lot of makeup so I can't say how well it removes makeup. But it's really good for basic cleaning and it's pleasant enough to use every day. Great face wash with a very pleasant light scent.  No adverse effects and I have sensitive skin.  Removes makeup very well.  I wish it had a thicker texture,  just my preference. It probably wouldn't be in a convenient pump bottle then though. As most women know, there are at least three steps to a skincare regime. Mixing and matching or using just one as a stand alone product won't give you full benefit of a skincare product, since they are formulated to work with companions used during another step of the routine. With that in mind, In order to evaluate this product properly, I either purchased or requested through Vine, the other pieces.  ( Please see my review of the toner and radiant moisturizer in this MEG 21 line) I then used all three products faithfully twice a day, every day for 30 days.  I can tell you it works.  Your results may vary ( after my testing period I tended to lapse on the twice daily routine. ). What I liked about this cleanser was that it was smooth and creamy without being overly oily feeling or heavily scented. It has a very faint scent, and the pump bottle is designed for easy use without contaminating the product.  It cleaned thoroughly without making my skin feel tight and rinsed off easily, it left no residue behind.  I avoided my eye area, but didn't encounter any irritating if it got on my lids while I rinsed. I highly recommend this. I'm 33 with oily, and acne prone skin. My acne is currently under control, but none the less, new products can sometimes cause a problem. First, I'll say that I was rather frustrated to not be able to find the ingredients to this product online, either here on Amazon, nor on the MEG21 website (atleast at the time of writing this review). Had I been able to see the ingredients I don't think I would have purchased. I will type them out at the bottom of this review.

Although I have oily skin, I have had good luck with cream cleansers in the past, and so wanted to give this a try. I have read about sugar damaging the skin/collagen, causing free radicals, etc, and so their marketing appealed to me. Upon first use, I was immediately taken aback by the fragrance. This is a highly fragranced product. The scent is hard to describe, but it's sort of like a 'spa smell' that is also fruity. Looking at the ingredient list, ""fragrance"" is the last ingredient, but there is also orange, lemon, tangerine, and rosemary essential oil. If you read up on skincare at all, then you probably know that fragrance and citrus oils are frowned upon in skincare products as being damaging/irritating to the skin.

Despite the fragrance, I continued using it because I don't like to waste things. I figured I'd use it up and just not purchase in the future. Well, after a week of use, my skin seemed very dry. Still oily, but with dry flaky skin. I found this very odd, because typically cream cleansers are moisturizing and the product description says it's hydrating. Well, again, looking at the product ingredients, I see that high on the ingredient list is 'fruit extracts', 'sugar cane extracts' and 'sugar maple extracts', these ingredients act like glycolic acid and salicylic acid, which of course are chemical exfoliants and can cause flaking skin. This is fine if you are looking for an exfoliating cleanser, except the product seems to be marketed as 'gentle', 'moisturizing', and for sensitive skin.

Ingredient list:

water, ppg-3 benzyl ether , myristate, glycerin, polysorbate 20, peg-8, dimethicone, soap bark extract, soapwort root extract, vaccinium myrtillus fruit/leaf extract, sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract, orange fruit extract, lemon extract, betaine, sodium pca, sorbitol, serin, glycine, glutamic, acid, alanine, lysine, arginine, threonine, profile, tangerine oil, rosemary oil, peg-40, hydrogenated castor oil, trideceth-9, acrylates/c10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, panthenol, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, frangrance. I like how the cleanser itself feels,  but I would caution against use on dry skin.  This seems to make my face unnecessarily dry feeling after using it.  It's not as moisturizing as it claims. I've been using this Moisturizing Cleanser for several weeks with good results. I do not have sensitive skin and am not prone to breakouts, so did not experience any side effects from daily us of this cleanser. I like the fresh, clean scent since I do not like heavily scented creams on my face, particularly at night. I wash my face just before going to bed with this cleanser, but it does not moisturize my very dry skin enough so I still have to apply another moisturizer. I do find the cleanser a bit watery if applied per instructions which specify adding water. If I do that, it just drips out of my hands before I can even apply it to my face. So I just pump a squirt into my hands, smooth it onto my face, rinse off and towel dry. I also find it a bit annoying that one has to avoid eye contact with a facial cleanser. I can't get my face completely clean with just one product if I can't get it near my eyes. Let me start by saying I have sensitive skin. I've tried a variety of products over the years. The ones that are cheap or full of fragrance tend to cause skin reactions for me. So I was quite encouraged when I saw this ""clean and clear"" product.

Unfortunately, it seems they are describing their elegant bottling and not the actual substance within.

The cleaner has a strong smell to it. It is so strong that even after I thoroughly washed it off my face it could be clearly smelled still on my skin. I don't want my soap to act as a perfume. And I definitely don't want a cleansing product to leave behind a layer of chemicals on my face. Neither one seems productive to me.

The texture of the cleanser is more like a lotion. Even when you mix in water it still smears on like a lotion - and it doesn't fully rinse off. Hence the lingering smell, one would say. Again, I don't want a lotion left on my face. I want this cleanser to cleanse. Yes, it's fine if it moisturizes the dryer sections of my face - but it can do that without seeming like you're smearing on thick sun tan lotion which sits on your face for hours afterwards.

If I wanted to use a lotion, I'd use a lotion after the cleansing. And if I wanted to use a perfume, I'd choose the specific perfume fragrance I wanted to wear for the occasion. I would never want my facial soap to dictate my fragrance of the evening.

I'm also just not keen on pump containers. They never manage to get all the material out of the container. So you're wasting material you paid for, unless you disassemble the unit and dig it out yourself.

I didn't see any results based on the magical claims they make here. It ""inactivates toxic sugars""? What?

If someone adores this fragrance and wants it to be their new daily fragrance, and they love suntan lotion on their face, then this is the perfect lotion for them. For me, I'll definitely pass. I have t-zone issues and aging skin that gets sensitive with the change of seasons. I got this cleanser with the hope that it would be able to handle such a big job. Unfortunately, it didn't do it for me.

Pros:
Gentle - did not over dry or irritate
scent is light enough not to irritate me

Cons:
Did nothing for the oily areas of my skin
Made my skin feel squeaky, but the oils seemed to work extra hard to replenish themselves
limited time on my skin actually feeling clean
Did nothing to prevent or get rid of pimples
Oil production increased under my make-up

I had hoped that this would be like the cold cream I used as a kid, but the clean feeling was unnatural and didn't last. It really felt like I had wiped my face with a napkin within an hour of washing. Yes, I have oily skin, but I've never had it bad enough to react that way on its own. I received this product and was very impressed with the bottle design.  The nice cover over the dispenser is something you don't see.  Since the name implied it was clean and clear, I proceeded to use it.  I even used it several days.  It makes a nice lather and felt good on my face.  But then came the rash!  This has fragrance in it!  Why does everything have to have added fragrance?!!  The description says for ""sensitive skin. ""  Well, I have sensitive skin and it can't take fragrances!!  I was very disappointed.  Everyone needs to know there is FRAGRANCE ADDED!!!When you have older skin ( I am 60) the line between really clean and overdrying is very slim. Older skin is less resilient and prone to be far more fragile than when younger. I really like the product. I've been using it for days and my skin feels in that sweet zone of clean but not tight and drawn. The product does not really lather but you mix it with water in your hand to cleanse. The scent to me is like the shore and is refreshing ( and like home to this Jersey girl). I love the container with its dispenser cover and careful pump.

I'm sold. I'll be buying it when this container runs out. Very pleased. This is a nice, gentle skin cleanser with just the right amount of moisturizer for my morning regimen - not too heavy, but keeps my skin feeling smooth and supple.  There is only the slightest scent to it - I only notice it when I'm washing, it doesn't seem to linger at all!While this product may do good things for my skin, I'm not crazy about the way it cleanses.  The instructions are ""Dispense, mix with water, and gently massage in a circular motion.  Rinse. ""  The problem for me is that it doesn't cleanse as well as I expected.  I've used it several times, and if I have foundation on my face, wiping my face with a Kleenex after cleansing shows there is still a trace of foundation on my face. Of course, I don't expect it to remove eye makeup, but I do expect it to remove all traces of foundation.

The cream/lotion is light and has a pleasant smell that seems familiar to me but that I cannot place.  It is not irritating to me, and would get a higher rating from me if it cleansed just a bit better.

1,0.9789997305296162,B019QSK1YG,B00GTESTLS,B00GTESTLS,"Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Cleansing Oil, 4 fl. oz.","My face can be a bit sensitive -- my go-to face wash is Cetaphil -- so I tested this cleansing oil by using it on one forearm and leaving it on my skin for quite a while before rinsing. The next morning, that area of my arm still felt smoother and more hydrated than the remaining skin, so I began using this product on my face.

The oils are light in consistency and have a slight, muted scent. A fine gloss of oil remains on your skin after use, but there's nothing shiny or sticky. In case you're wondering about the organic fruit acids that Juice has included to help dissolve impurities, I haven't felt any unpleasant after-effects while applying this cleansing oil to my face. After rinsing and drying, my skin does not feel stretched or tight, unlike the sensations I've had with other cleansers. It also gets my face clean: it gets rid of perspiration and such after a warm afternoon's worth of yard work.

Although this oil works effectively and rinses cleanly when following the standard instructions, I especially enjoy following Juice's suggested ""spa-like cleanse. "" All you do is apply a few pumps of the product to a warm, moist washcloth, and clean your face in circular motions using the cloth. After you rinse your face and the washcloth with warm water, you cover your face with the clean, damp cloth. It's a relaxing end-of-day ritual. I love the way this makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. The product has a clean, fresh smell with no perfumey smell. It does not leave an oily residue. I have sensitive skin but this did not irritate my skin at all. I think this will be my new go-to facial cleanser. Very different experience! I've never tried cleansing with oil but this works very well, either applied to a dry face and rinsed off or applied with a wet washcloth. It removes makeup completely but without any scrubbing, leaving your face clean and soft. I am very impressed.  This oil goes on smoothly and quickly absorbs into your skin.  Make-up all but evaporates.  I experienced no burning around the eyes when I used it to clean off mascara.

Clean up just requires a warm wet washcloth.  My skin usually feels tight after I've washed it so I almost always apply a moisturizer immediately afterwards.  Not so with this treatment.  I won't give up my night cream, but I'll be looking forward to letting my skin breathe through the effects of this potion for a few hours before bed.

There's no overpowering fragrance.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle is generously sized.  Certified organic. My skin is really dry, especially in the winter. It is painful to wash my skin, even just to rinse it off. I had been using cold creams to help me remove makeup and cleanse, but I wasn't in love with them.

The oil cleanser is an absolute game changer for me. My skin actually feels good, it is retaining moisture well and is clean! I didn't even know something like this existed.

What I like most about the product is that it is made entirely from organically sourced ingredients. Everything on the label is safe, and as a nursing mother I am completely comfortable using this on my skin.

The bottle should last a couple of months, and I will be sure to not let it run out. This cleanser is exactly what I needed!I love this cleansing oil. It really makes the skin feel smooth & clean. Easy pump, and smells great. This one is a winner!!  Why did nobody think of this earlier??  This is absolutely the best type of cleanser I've used on my face.  It melts my makeup off like butter, and it really feels like it got down into my pores and left me with a super clean face, but not with that weird tight squeaky clean feeling.  It feels so gentle going on, there's no way this can be harsh on your skin. Oil to clean the face?  Who would have thought.  If you read up, the oil is best at dissolving impurities.  It's light weight, and great at removing eye make up.  It leaves my skin smelling wonderful and so soft.

My skin type is normal to dry, and I feel this brightens my skin tone.  And keeps my skin hydrated.  Smells refreshing too!  I've already bought this twice, and will continue to purchase as a daily cleanser. Does dissolve makeup, but leaves my skin extremely greasy. I have to wash with a soap, then use a toner afterwards. I won't be purchasing again. I'll just use an organic oil to do the same job. Love it! Easy to use and leaves your skin feeling so softI have been using this cleanser for about 4 months now, and I just started my second bottle.  I never imagined I would like using an oil as a cleanser.  I've always had problematic skin, VERY dry and prone to breakouts, especially when I would try to moisturize my dry skin.  I decided to give this a shot, and I'm really glad I did.  My skin feels very soft and hydrated after using this.  I pump 1 or 2 pumps into my palm and massage all over my face, then I use my clarisonic brush to exfoliate, once in the morning and once at night, then I rinse with warm water.  It does tend to leave a bit of the oil on my face, and I'm ok with that, because once I pat dry with a towel it's gone.  It leaves my face feeling hydrated and luminous, which is what I want.  It has not made me breakout whatsoever.  Everyone has their own preference though, and this works for me, so I will continue to purchase. After trying various oil cleansers for years, a friend recommended this one to me (not sure how I hadn't tried it before, I love Juice Beauty)... and it's amazing!  Works like a charm, and smells lovely too. Made me breakout, and pump broke easily. I have used this product in the past and loved it, however I do believe they have changed the ingredients, my skin was very dry and irritated after a week of use. I absolutely love this product. An oil cleansing wash that leaves the skin well hydrated afterward is just wonderful for dry or combination skin. I would definitely repurchase this product again. I just bought my second bottle which is really saying something for me, I'm always looking for something ""better"". This product has totally changed my skin. This is the first juice beauty product I've ever tried. It makes my skin feel clean, plump, glowing!! I typically use a wipe to quickly get some of the makeup off my face first then use this (i wear a good amount of makeup) sometimes twice to make sure I got it all off. It truly does remove anything left behind. I wet my fingertips and then add the oil (sparingly) and rub into my skin. I highly highly recommend. Baby bottom skin product alert! So happy with this product. I love this product.  For years, I would simply apply a pump of jojoba oil to my face to remove the day.  This does a very similar job but is a bit more luxurious.  The consistency is richer, a bit thicker, smells very nice and overall feels wonderful.  I buy it now and cut it with my jojoba oil because it's a bit on the pricey side for an oil compound but either way, a nice addition to my nightly cleansing ritual. I found this was not a very effective cleanser and it leaves a greasy film on the skin. I've never used a cleansing oil because I hate anything thick and greasy on my face but I don't have that problem with this cleanser because it leaves my face leaving so amazingly soft and looking so clean. I love it. Will definitely purchase again. Best cleanser on the marketAt first the price made me think twice but I finally bought it and I love it for a daily face cleanser and especially for removing makeup. I have struggled with acne since my pre teen days but after switching from makeup wipes to this my skin is so much clearer. I recommend trying it if you're willing to spend the money I'm 3/4 done with my first bottle and ordering the next. I honestly don't know how people can possibly not like this product, I'm shocked! I've only been using this product for 2 days & I already LOVE ITTT. It breaks up all my makeup up so effortlessly I can't believe it. I then take a damp washcloth & it leaves my skin feeling so hydrated!Why do I feel like this product is like putting pure oil on my face? Even after rinsing it numerous times, I can't get the oily residue off my face.  There was makeup smeared all over my face and I had to use another cleanser to remove it all. Is anyone else experiencing this?  I've always read good reviews about this product. I'm wondering if I received the authentic product.  The box was also dirty and there was no product info sheet included. Definitely not worth the price I paid. I really really wanted to love this product because one of my favorite youtubers raves about it and all of the reviews here are great too. When I use this on my face the makeup does not come off. I rinse and then towel dry and it looks like all of my makeup is now in the towel! Foundation, mascara, everything. This would be a cleanser for after washing your face and completely removing makeup but then I feel as though I am not receiving the product properties to my skin as well. I am so bummed!Left my skin feeling oily and unclean. Won't repurchase. I have a hard time finding a cleanser that doesn't dry out my skin. This one leaves my skin perfectly balanced. This stuff is amazing! I wear full coverage makeup looks and this is my go to. First I use a wipe(from Costco) to get a good majority off then I go in and wash my face with this. Anything left on my face is removed. It's unusual at first because it's an oil so when you rinse your face it doesn't come right off. Give it time! I gently rub my face with water and it loosens up, then as I dry my face I gently wipe any access oil off. It leaves my skin so moisturized and soft. I will definitely repurchase and I'm looking forward to trying other products from this line!I have oily skin. Bought it because it's supposed to be good for any skin type. Primarily got it to remove my make up. My experience was left my skin feeling too oily face did not feel clean after using it. Still have to use a different face wash after it. Did an ok job removing makeup. Would not repurchase. A little background: I have dry, sensitive skin, eczema (although a soft water heater for your shower really helps a lot, so I haven't had flare ups in a while), and a somewhat oily T-zone.

This is an oil cleanser that works well in getting makeup off, especially mascara (don't use waterproof mascara, though).  Very nice texture and feels good when applying.  Most of the time I use one pump, but sometimes 1. 5 to ensure all mascara is off.  Careful if you don't plan on washing your hair after.  Noticed a couple little blemishes pop up around the hairline after first couple of uses.  Now I just make sure to really get any leftover product from my hairline/baby hairs and all is good again.  Leaves the skin feeling very hydrated after, even after applying toner to get the excess off.  I would recommend this product. I love this so much! I have combination skin with some really oily areas in the T-zone. I couldn't fathom putting oil on my face but this product makes my face feel so soft and healthy. I use it to take my eye makeup off too because it does not irritate my eyes. I also use the green apple cleanser in the morning but use this before bed to get extra moisture. Love this product line so much!I have oily, acne prone skin.  This is a God-send.  Keeps my skin clear and moisturized and I love the feel when I wash my face!  A plus from me!Five stars on the product. One star on the price!

Shocked at the price!  This is $26 on their website as well as ULTA.  JB is charging way too much for this to prime members.  I'm sure it's cause of shipping charges they incur.

This product is great and I've been using it many years. Love not putting chemicals on my face. I have mature skin and I have very few wrinkles.  I know it's from the Green Apple products I'm using.  I also have very oily skin and it seems to keep that under control as well.

I hate I can't get it under my Prime membership but I'm not gonna pay this price when I can get it cheaper else where. I like it, although it tends to leave my skn feeling a bit taut... would be perfect for normal  and combination  skins... for my skin which is on the dry side, I prefer it n summer. I prefer something more hydrating in winter. I've used a lot of Juice Beauty products and have always been very pleased. This is no exception. I never, ever wear make up of any kind, so I can't comment on this product's ability to remove makeup, but it's a great, hydrating cleanser. It's viscous and easy to dispense, but has good body going on and rinses cleanly. If you live in a dry climate, or have acne-prone or sensitive skin, this is the business. Absolutely love this product! I was nervous at first to buy this because I have really oily & acne prone skin & was nervous to wash my face with oil but I surprisingly haven't broke out once from it! It does wonders! It removes all my make up & is so gentle! The reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 is because after rinsing off it does leave your face a little oily feeling but goes away after a while! Definitely worth buying. nice product but I'm sold on the Juice Beauty Green Apple Cleansing Gel, 4 fl. oz. . I think this product may be better for winter. still on the fence.
Not sure if I would purchase again. this is a great product for dry skin!Literally melts my makeup off my face to make it a million times easier to rinse off. The oil is also great for my dry skin. I sometimes apply a small amount and leave it on over night and wake up with very soft skin. Great product, all my makeup melts right off. Leaves my mature skin soft. Delivery as expected and great productIt works really well getting off my foundation and and everything except maybe for my mascara. I bought this as a makeup remover because oil are much more gentle on my skin and I am less prone to acne breakouts. Too oily for me, but otherwise an okay product.  Just didn't feel like my face was clean when using it. Finally a super hydrating cleanser that cleans all my makeup off!This is a good product but I was not a big fan of it. It really does polish the face. Great stuff. Along these lines, I recently discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juice-Beauty-Stem-Cellular-Cleansing/dp/B00GTESTLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B00WB864Q8 Ageless Organic Cleansing Foam</a>, and found it is not only all-natural, but it actually improves my skin.  The apricot kernel oil smells great, and has kept my skin feeling soft, smooth, and breakout free. I love it as a daily cleanser because of how hydrating and nourishing it is. Highly recommend!Purchased this cleansing oil because I was getting dry patches around my eyes from my other face wash. I have to admit I was a little scared to put oil on my face, but after washing my face my skin felt so smooth. But in the morning I had 3 big pimples on my chin, kind of freaked out and only used this oil every other night to let my face rest from the oil if this makes any sense. I would not recommend this oil if you have acne prone skin. I am a huge fan of Juice Beauty, have been for a while. Really like this cleansing oil. First time every using a cleansing oil and so far pretty impressed. I like the way it makes my skin feel after and does not break me out at all. However I did make the mistake of trying to use this with my Clarisonic (didn't think it through) and the oil made my brush kinda nasty.. I would totally get this again. Does not emulsify at all and leaves a layer of oil on your skin after washing off. I love this cleansing oil. It gives my face a glow and doesn't dry me out. I do feel oil on my skin even after I dry with a towel, but it absorbs fairly quickly. first time writing a review because i felt so disappointed and i had to write this review. I bought this face wash because one of the makeup girl on youtube raved about it so much and i thought it must be really good specially when it dissolves makeup. When i washed my face i had makeup on and i massaged it all over my dry face it felt really oily and i have a combination skin type and i didn't have water proof mascara on when i was done and rinse my face i went to dry it all my makeup came on my towel and i used cotton ball with toner after and my makeup was still in my skin and my mascara was still there which i had to use makeup wipes to clean it. Very disappointed left my skin oily when i woke up in the morning i had couple pimples in my forehead because of so much oiliness. I do not recommend this and i guess the youtubers gets paid for reviewing product and i was a fool to believe it. Rosacea, sensitive skin and oil?  First, it is important to note I am switching over from Skinceuticals which has controlled my Rosacea for over 20 years now.  However, the $500 price tag every 3 months can be a bit expensive to say the least.

The first time I used the product, it was hard to get over the feeling of rubbing oil onto my skin and after rinsing (and rinsing again) I wondered how my skin would feel and look.  First, no burning and second no itching.  I haven't tried it with my clarisonic or seen how the week test will work out, but I am feeling optimistic. This was one of those what-the-heck choices of items for me to review.  I am not a person who has a beauty regimen, never have.  If I'm lucky, I remember to moisturize. So when I was reading up on this product, I was thinking, ""Oil to clean the face - how's that supposed to work?"".  Like others, I had oily skin when I was younger so using an oil-based product was a big no-no, and my instinctive reaction is shy away from such a product.

I tested the product first on my arm to make sure that I didn't have any type of weird allergic response to it. Everything was fine.

It's very odd to be smearing oil all over your face to clean it.  I followed the instructions, and after rinsing and drying my face, I was surprised that it didn't have that sort of coated-feeling that comes after using an oily/creamy product. My skin felt clean and smooth - neither dry nor oily.

Is this going to give me the skin of a twenty-year old?

Probably not.

But it did a good job of cleaning my older skin without drying it out and without it feeling odd afterward.  Who knew?  Cleaning with oil works well. I wash my face with a mixture of castor oil and olive oil. I wanted a little more to my face regimen and I love Juice Beauty. I have bought my second bottle and I definitely will continue to buy it :)I've tried the oil cleansing method a few times but my skin just really wasn't a fan and went back to a traditional cleanser.  I decided to give it a go again with Juice Beauty and see if perhaps THIS was the time that would make all the difference.  It is OK but I really feel like my traditional cleanser is still doing a better job for MY skin (YMMV).  However, I have been using this to remove makeup and other than stubborn mascara it does a great job so I am going to continue with this method and follow this up with my traditional cleanser.  This may work for others but for me using it as JUST a cleanser wasn't a total win. I have relatively dry skin and I've never used any kind of oil for it. I was a bit hesitant to try this, especially after rubbing some on my hand and seeing how much it glistens and is, well, oily. But when used in the way that the instructions suggest - rubbing in light circles, rinsing off with warm water and then patting dry - the result is actually refreshing with a nice afterglow that keeps my skin feeling less dry the next day. There's still something weird about putting oil on my face that I haven't warmed up to but I like this stuff. I have (mature haha) combination skin that is dry in some places, very oily in my T-zone and acne prone. I found this facial cleanser to be mediocre in removing dirt and oil as I did still find remains of makeup when I followed up with my astringent. I feel like this was gentle and mild on my skin but being that my skin breaks out like a teenager, I was not pleased with the make up that it left behind. I can't whole heartedly recommend this to those with skin such as mine. After many battles with oily skin in my younger days, I never would have expected to like an oil based cleanser as much as I do this product. Nowadays, I have that diabetes dry skin and this cleansing oil really relieves it. This is very easy to use, spread it on the face, wet your hands and emulsify it, and rinse. I do have a slight oily feel on my face afterwards (hands too), but it goes away after a bit - I wouldn't want to apply makeup right after rinsing and drying (haven't attempted it yet). I am also very sensitive to strong perfumes/odors and I don't notice any with this product, a huge plus for me. I've been using this for about a week now and really notice a difference in my skin tone and dryness. This is definitely a product I would think about purchasing, despite the hefty (for me) price tag, and I'd also like to explore other products in this line of skin care.

My only problem (if you could call it that) at getting the oil to pump was I didn't realize the little plastic thingy on the pump was to keep it from pumping during shipping and needed to be removed. My bad. I've tried other cleansing oils and had just run out of my usual brand when I say this one and thought I'd give it a try.  First, it feels nice on the skin when in use and it does leave my skin looking younger with fewer signs of aging such as deep smile creases -- it sort of plumps them out.

You use this oil on a dry face with dry hands and massage it into your skin.  It heats up as you massage it in.  Then you rinse it off with warm water.  This does work and if this is all you do as a first step in your cleansing routine it will also be a decent base for whatever you do next.  However, since I don't wear make-up and usually cleanse, use toner and then moisturizer and that's it -- it works for me.

I find though that after I use this cleansing oil, I then use a bit of olive oil soap to wash and then add toner and moisturizer and it really makes a big difference in making me feel that my skin looks healthy and with fewer signs aging laugh lines and crows feet.  I added the mild soap step because it did feel a bit like a surface barrier on my face.  My previous oil based cleanser rinsed off leaving my face feeling cleaned while this leaves a bit more of a 'coated' feeling for me than I like.  It's not heavy but I did feel like I could feel it.  Others may have no problem with this but since I use so little on my face it doesn't take much to make me feel like I do have a coating -- so take that into consideration because on the whole I really like the way the cleansing oil make my skin feel -- soft and pliant. I was very curious about how this cleanser would work, since slathering oil on my face didn't sound very clean. But I saw the positive reviews and thought I'd give it a go.

This oil has a very light neutral scent. It doesn't smell nice or bad, and I can't really describe it at all. A single pump is enough for your whole face. It feels pretty nice going on, but I am not fond of the emulsion process (you are supposed to wet your finger tips and then massage the oil into your skin). It feels kind of messy and and I don't enjoy it. Next you are supposed to rinse and then pat dry, but you will still have oil on your face after that. Which is fine, it doesn't feel bad. Some reviewers say that it makes their skin feel soft or smooth, but I didn't notice any particular benefit.

As a makeup remover, this is great, and that is probably all I will use it for in the future. I don't like it much as just a cleanser. I have yet to try the suggested spa treatment, but it sounds awesome: you take a warm wet cloth and pump some oil onto it, use it to massage your face, then rinse and finish by laying a damp cloth over your face and just relaxing. When I first opened my Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Cleansing Oil, I wondered just how well it would work.  Oil to clean my face?  I wanted to remove the oils and makeup residue that was still on my face, not make it more oily.  I had never tried it before but after doing so and reading more about the product, it makes sense.  The oils on my skin were attracted to the oil in this cleanser and after using it my face felt smoother, more supple and so soft.  More importantly for me is that once I did wash my face with this cleansing oil did not leave my face feeling really dry.  The light scent of the product is refreshing without being overpowering.  You can apply it to your skin by either using the pump directly into your hand and massaging it onto your skin with your fingertips or applying some of the oil to a warm cloth and applying to skin that way.  I tried both ways and found that personally I preferred using the soft cloth to massage the oil into my skin.  Removing makeup was easy and I didn't get a sense that I had a lot of residue on my face afterwards.  I ended up with my skin feeling so soft and fresh.

I like knowing the I am putting organic products on my face and not something that has petroleum as one of the main ingredients.  Those products only make my face feel worse.  I have tried several of the Juice Beauty products, the Age Defy Moisturizer, the Stem Cellular Moisturizer and now the Stem Cellular Cleansing Oil and have found so far that I like the products. The Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Cleansing oil offers a deep cleansing experience. It uses a blend of Grapeseed, May Chang, Ho wood and Sunflower oils along with organic fruit acids to brighten skin tone, skin texture and help dissolve impurities.

Juice Cleansing oil is recommended to be applied to dry skin. One can apply it the face with fingers in a circular massaging way; or you can squeeze it into a warm, well wrung-out washcloth and massage your face with it.

I prefer the washcloth as there is warm moisture being applied to my face along with the cleansing oil; and the washcloth can pick up impurities along the way. The finger method seems to tug at the skin and stretch it unnecessarily - especially near the eyes, where one has thinner skin.

Juice Cleansing oil leaves the skin clean, nourished, non-greasy and smelling good - just like you do after a spa treatment!

Recommended.

Pros:
* Spa like experience in a bottle
* Organic product - all natural ingredients
* Leaves skin clean, nourished and rejuvenated without the greasiness
* Two methods of application - massage into skin or spray onto moist warm washcloth
* Non-abrasive cleansing

Cons:
* Seems to stretch thin skin areas - apply gently with care. I have been wanting to try oil cleansing but have slacked about doing my research to make it happen, so this product was fantastic for me. The oil is super-light and doesn't leave even a hit of oiliness once rinsed off, yet it removes even my most heavy duty makeup with ease.

My favorite part is that that my skin never feels dry after washing; it is basically hydrated and soft. As long as it continues to work and not cause breakouts, I will very likely repurchase this. This went to my wife to use. She is in her mid-30's and has been trying some natural oil based cleaners recently. She really liked this one. She said it worked well, in that it cleaned effectively. She said it was light and left no residue. Also said it has not caused any adverse reactions or break outs for her. The cleaners she was using prior to my asking her to try this one have not re-appeared on our counter and she has told me she will use this one until it is gone as she likes it. I wasn't sure what to think about using an oil for cleansing.  There were several different options written on the bottle as far as possible uses, so I first went with - as a makeup remover.  This worked well, it took off most of my make up and didn't cause any issues around my eyes.  But rinsing it off was difficult and I felt very greasy before going to bed when compared with my normal makeup remover.

So I started using this before taking my shower in the morning.  Two pumps into my hand, step in the shower and rub it all over my face (in tiny circles as described on the bottle).  This actually worked.  It seems to get off any residual makeup from the day before and leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized by the time I get out of the shower.  I have been doing this for a week now and have not had any new massive breakouts. That was what had worried me because even though my skin is dry, any added oil tends to break me out.

I haven't seen any over all change in my skin, other then it being less dry after my morning shower.  If I see any difference after finishing the bottle I will update.  Though I like this, I do think that the current asking price is a bit more than I would be comfortable spending - but we will see. I use a mix of almond oil and vitamin E oil to remove my makeup. I wasn't sure if an oil cleanser would be too much, but it isn't, especially since the weather has turned cold. I recommend using this with fingertips rather than a washcloth as it is thin and has no ""slip"" like soap does. This is keeping my skin, which tends to be just slightly dry in cold weather, hydrated and healthy. The only negative is the smell. There's a slight odor that makes me wonder ""Why am I smelling hot dogs, what is going on??"" but it isn't offensive, just a little strange. When I got this cleansing oil, my teenage inner child popped up and told my plenty-something self ""You're going to get zits if you put oil on your face!""  Happily my inner teen was completely wrong.

This is a very light oil and it massages into the skin easily and took my makeup off really well.  People who are used to a ""squeaky clean"" feel to their skin may be disconcerted.  After I rinse it off, my skin feels soft and a little bit moisturized, but not oily.

I'm not sure how this would work for someone younger who has oilier skin, but for ""women of a certain age"" or older, this is a good product.  I have been pleasantly surprised by how well it works.  It doesn't feel like it strips the natural oils from my skin while it is cleansing it.

Update:  The more I use this, the more I like it.  My skin has been looking better and I think it really does a good job of cleansing.  I'm still surprised that oil is good for cleansing but am a believer.  It is a little pricey but I think I will have to keep buying this when my bottle runs out. I was looking forward to trying this cleansing oil. I have oily skin, and if you do research, you're actually supposed to ""fight"" oil with oil. I've been using some Suki products, another natural line. I haven't been using ALL of them, because they are expensive, but I have a cleanser from that company that I really like.

The Juice Beauty oil is to be put on your face dry, and then you wet your fingers and rub it in/cleanse your face. To me, the oil felt really thin and didn't give me that ""ooh, my face is clean"" feeling. I guess I'm just used to cleansers that are thicker, so mentally, it feels like they're doing their job more. I'm sure this actually does help clean my face, but I like my Suki cleanser (and also my Bioelements cleanser) a lot more. Finally, this oil has a smell... it's not bad, but I wouldn't say that it's good either.

So, while I like that it's an organic/natural brand with clean ingredients and whatnot, I'm not overly impressed by this oil and would not buy more when my current bottle runs out. I've had an oily/combination skin ever since my teens. I'm in my early 50's now, but still have breakouts. So, you can understand my hesitation about using an oil to cleanse my face. I rubbed a little oil between my hands and applied to my face. It's kind of an odd sensation to apply oil for cleansing, but it made my skin very soft and clean. I like the fact that this brand doesn't add chemicals to their products. My only reason for 4 stars is the scent of the product which is a little medicinal. I look forward to trying more in this line. I picked this cleansing oil up with the intention of using it myself but after one use turned it over to my young adult and teenaged daughters. The reason? I don't wear makeup at all except for the odd occasion and felt that this product was more suitable for those who do, plus I was concerned about the concentration of oil in the product for my skin type. Here are our thoughts:

Me - 52, don't wear makeup, normal skin, no real issues. The product seemed too oily to me, I worried it would cause break outs if I used it regularly. (I tried an EVO regime a couple of years ago and was broken out for months afterwards, so I am very worried about using oils on my skin. ) The smell of the product was kind of antiseptic to me and I did not love that either. 2. 5 Stars from me.

Young Adult Daughter - 22, prone to hormonal breakouts, wears standard powder face makeup (Bare Essentials type stuff) and eye liner, mascara, eye brow pencil. She initially used this cleanser to remove Halloween makeup. She said it worked but did not get off all of the eye makeup. (There was a lot of that!) She since has been using it to remove regular makeup and she thinks it works well and feels nice. She does not love the oily texture of the product. She has not mentioned the product odor. 3. 5 stars from her.

Teenaged Daughter - 13, prone to the usual teenaged breakouts, wears light powder, eye liner, eyebrow pencil. She loves this product. Feels it works much better than what she had been using before. (Philosophy cleanser. ) She is okay with the oiliness of the product but likened the smell to Lysol. 4. 5 stars from her.

Recommended with above reservations - 3. 5 stars rounded up to 4 for purposes of review. (I will update and change rating after a months usage, if need be. )Oh my!  I am quite pleased with this Juice Beauty Cleansing Oil.  I have oily, yet sensitive, skin, and finding a good facial cleansing product is definitely a challenge.  I usually alternate between Liquid Neutrogena and Burts Bees Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream.  The Neutrogena tends to dry my skin out a little too much, and the Burts Bees usually leaves it feeling a bit too oily and not quite clean enough.  Neither is safe to use around the eyes, so I end up needing to use something else entirely to remove my eye make-up.

None of these problems exist with Juice Beauty Cleansing Oil.  I was initially a little nervous using an oil based cleanser on my already oily skin, but I neednt have been. The first time I tried Juice Beauty was after a long day with a face full of make-up.  I was thrilled to discover I could use it to remove my eye make-up as well as using it on the rest of my face, and it worked beautifully.  My make-up dissolved without any harsh scrubbing, and my skin was left feeling nice and firm and oh-so-soft.  My skin didn't feel either dried out or oily; it felt perfect.

Im definitely very pleased with this product.  I feel as if I have finally found the perfect cleanser for my difficult skin, and as an added bonus, Juice Beauty Cleaning Oil has a nice, light citrusy scent, which I love.  Yes, I am very pleased indeed. I wish they had said this on their packaging or somewhere - Not for Oily Skin.  Not that it doesn't work for Oily Skin - I'm sure it's still good for my skin and all - it has a pleasant aroma.  But for someone with oily skin, the last thing I want to do is smear more oil on it, rub it all in, then rinse off.  It's like I didn't do anything to clean my face at all.  It feels like I smeared more oil on top of my already oily skin and despite the nice aroma... it just feels gross to me.

 I would suspect this is a product loved by people with dry skin who wish they had a little oil in their life.  In that respect, this product is great!  It does as it claims.  It's a clean and clear oil that smells very nice.  You apply it onto your dry hands and face, rub it in, then work some water in until you finally rinse it off with more water and pat dry.  It removes makeup and any other impurities in your skin.  It's a light oil that doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy, but you are supposed to wipe it all off.  I still had to use a moisturizer afterwards. I am very care full about what I use on my skin.  Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Oil does a great job of cleaning.  It leaves a nice feel to my skin as well as a nice look. This is a  organic product with a high price tag but it only takes a small amount each time you use it.  If you have sensitive skin as I do this is a good product to use. So it says on the box that this oil, and yes it's an oil, will purify, soften and balance skin's natural moisture with this formula of grapeseed, may chang, ho wood and sunflower oils. (the stem cells are from fruit, I was curious too). It's supposed to help brighten skin tone and texture and to help dissolve impurities. They say its age less, I'm assuming it will work on any age. I'm in my mid forties and I still have lightly oily skin and I have to use an astringent in the middle of the day to clean it. Let's see how it does.

I rubbed some in my hands and massage it onto my face then as directed wet my fingertips and massage it even more. It feels nice, it doesn't smell like anything, not even oil, absolutely neutral. I rinsed it off and there you go.

My face feels smoother, softer, but I did just put oil on my face. I have medium sized pores, and a little acne from eating things I shouldn't, I'm not sure what impurities it will dissolve but if my face looks better and feels great after some time using it - then awesome! I'll get back to you...

Face feels a little oily, not clean. It's a little disconcerting. I'm almost starting to wonder if Juice Beauty is for people with dry skin after trying another of their products.

A few days later .... I found after a few times it rinses off better with warmish-hot water so it doesn't feel oily.

4 stars

I think it would take a good few months using this to truly see how well this will work. After using it for a while I find my skin feels nicer, I haven't had to use astringent as much and the acne seems to be healing.  I'd say give it a try, but I can't with complete confidence recommended it to everyone. 4 stars because of the ingredients and it does seem to be helping, loses 1 star because I wish the company wouldn't be so vague about what skin type this works best for. If it is for all types, then some direction for each type would be helpful. First of all, this smells good.  You pump some into your dry hands and rub it on your face.  Then you wet your fingertips and rub your face some more.  It feels amazing.  Then you rinse off with warm water.  I like to wipe off with a wet washcloth.  The oil comes off just fine, yet enough is left behind to soften and hydrate your skin.

I haven't used this long enough to know if it's going to cause break outs, though this 45 year old skin doesn't seem to have a problem with break outs anymore. :)You wouldn't think that an oil can clean your face, but this one really does.

I have somewhat dry, sensitive skin so never know exactly how I'm going to react to a skin product. For that reason I really do look for the more organic brands.

I loved this cleanser. It cleaned off my make-up really well and left my skin soft. It's my new cleanser and recommended!I've never washed my face with an oil before. This was a new experience for me. First of all, the smell... a bit odd, can't really place what I'm smelling but it's not bad. It's a subtle smell, not overpowering as many scented things tend to be. The oil spreads and yet isn't too runny. It doesn't have the consistency of say, massage oil. The bottle gives you three options for use: putting it on a dry face and then adding water and rinsing it off (which I did), makeup removal, and also a spa-like experience, which I don't have the time or patience to try.

I found it removed my make just fine using method one. And I must say, I'm very impressed with it as a makeup remover.

It also made my skin feel so soft that I thought at first I hadn't gotten all the oil off. But I had. And when I dried off, my face feels like silk. I'm also not having an allergic reaction and I tend to be a bit sensitive. That brings to mind something else I like about it: it doesn't contain cucumber as so many face things seem to contain. I'm allergic so that's a plus for me.

My skin also had a healthier glow after use than it usually does. And not the shiny glow. My skin is neither oily or dry. I recommend this product. I'd been using plain grapeseed oil for oil cleansing and decided to splurge and try this. I love it! More than worth it. I have oily/acne prone skin and this cleanser has actually helped clear my skin I think by not over stripping it. It is great. The oil makes my face so soft and has helped to cear up my dry skin.  Like all natural face wash I find that I must wash for the full 2 minutes. I use this as part of my makeup removal routine (see Desi Perkins on YouTube) and its perfect for my dry skin! I use it the way she does in her video and it makes a great post cleanser, after Ive been wiping with makeup wipes, because its extremely gentle but still grabs the excess foundation I miss. Definitely will repurchase when I run out!2 weeks in and very pleased w this product.  I have struggled w exzema, rosacea, clogged pores and dry skin.  This cleanser leaves my skin clean, glowing and quenched after using.  I did get a few small break outs in the first 5 days as my skin was getting used to the new product but I knew that would pass.  I live in NYC and everything gets soooo dirty from the pollution so on some days I will use a micellear water before this product to get my skin extra clean.  Definitely looking forward to trying more from juice beauty. Was having terrible breakouts that wouldnt go away, I switched to this cleanser and my breakouts have cleared up in 3 days! Makes skin feel super soft not dried out like other cleaners. This actually helped control my oily skin as well! Will purchase again. Gentle on sensitive skin and not drying. I recently introduced this oil cleanser into my routine as I've been trying to follow the Korean beauty routine (google it). I love it and it smells great. I'm on my 2nd bottle. Some have said that they don't feel that it washes off all their makeup. I do not believe this is a product that should just be used on it's own. I use a makeup wipe first to get off the majority of my makeup, then I use this, then I use a water-based cleanser, and then a toner because I lotion. This has worked great for me but if you are a one product type gal, this might not work for you. Nice light oil. Will re purchase, but doesn't thoroughly take all my make up off. I use it for already two weeks now and it's an amazing product!!!! you may use this cleansing oil alone to remove make up, but I first use a la roche posay micellar water to remove my makeup and then cleanse with it thoroughly - it is very safe for eyes as well. afterwards the skin feels like a silk. I have sensitive skin, combination to dry, with a light redness, and it has not caused any problems to my very very sensitive skin. I recommend this product highly!!!! (by the way the skin doesn't feel oily at all!)I purchased this product because a beauty Guru that I love and have followed for years recommend it. Usually, I love the things she positively recomends, however, this product did not cut it for me. I wear quite a lot of makeup day to day, (full glam) and I wanted something to help dissolve it all at the end of my night so I could get in deeper with my facial cleanser.
When I applied this product it felt like I was rubbing olive oil on my face. I know that it's a ""cleansing oil"" but it didn't feel like it cleansed a thing. the consistency is thick and goopy and it didn't do a very good job at removing my makeup at all. in fact its pretty darn tough to get off of your face after you have applied it. you have to either go in right after with a real cleanser or wipe it away with a wet cloth to remove it all. using your hands alone won't get it off.
I'm quite disappointed that I didn't like this product. however, I have used a couple other oil cleansers since and I can say that if you try this and it doesn't work for you, you should try the ""Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil""  or the "" ERNO LASZLO
Hydra-Therapy Cleansing Oil"" both which are sold by Sephora.  they work incredibly and really get all your products off, so you can efficiently clean your skin with facewash afterwords.

It might be in my head, but I do like change things up.  I like oil based cleaners, I have large pores, combination, super sensitive skin.  The oil based cleansers make my face feel pumped up and dewy, without over drying my face and oddly without clogging my pores.

A little bit goes a long way.  I like to rub the oil cleanser on first, then after I have worked the cleanser for awhile I like to add the water and create a little bit of lather and rinse off.  I don't like over perfumey cleansers, this has little to no scent.  It can clean your waterproof eye makeup off.  My skin did not have that painful dry feeling.  I almost forgot to put my nighttime moisturizer on.

This is really great stuff.  I like oil cleansers.  They are good for your face, the older your skin gets the more moisture it needs.  I would use this again. Not thrilled with this cleanser, did not like smell. This is a wonderful cleansing oil. It removes all my makeup and leaves my skin soft. This face cleanser dissolves the makeup away without drying out your skin.  I love this product!It's okay. If I had never tried another cleansing oil, I'd rate this 5 stars because I love cleansing oils in general, and even though this is just ""okay"" for a cleansing oil, it's better than any non-oil cleanser than I've tried before. But when I compare it to MAC Cleanse Off Oil, I can only give it 3 stars. This oil is a little thicker and is a little fragranced which I don't like, as I am sensitive to fragrance. It does a good job of removing my makeup, but again, not as good as the MAC Cleanse Off Oil. But with L'Occitane you get 1. 7 more ounces for about $8 less, so that's a bonus of L'Occitane. I will continue to use it until it's gone, but I won't be repurchasing it. I'm so glad L'Occitane has introduced this new face oil!

After years of using drugstore skincare products, I decided last year that it was time to start treating my combination, often-difficult skin to some more luxurious products. A friend recommend L'Occitane and I've been really pleased with their products so far. This cleansing oil is one of the more moderately-priced items in their range - and it's worth every penny!

In the past I've used foam or gel cleansers, hoping to tame occasional breakouts, but at the expense of my skin's moisture, volume and brightness. I was worried that an oil would make my often 'angry' skin even more sensitive, but this product leaves my skin soft and 'plump' rather than greasy. With just one use, the dryness I often experience on my nose and cheeks was completely gone (even in the harsh winter weather!) and, even better, after three weeks of daily use my occasional breakouts have become so occasional as to be almost non-existent!

While the product details state that the oil can be applied to wet or dry skin, I'd recommend only slightly dampening your hands and/or face before applying. Rubbing the oil into dry skin doesn't give as much lather, even when water is added afterwards, and getting the skin too wet (in the shower, for example) may allow the product to slide off before you can get a good cleanse.

The oil is a little pricey (especially compared to the drugstore brands I'm used to), but it seems to be quite long-lasting. It also has a nice comforting scent (not floral or medicinal like some reviewers have found the Immortelle range). I pair this product with L'Occitane's Immortelle Precious Cream as my moisturizer and it gives me the perfect amount of hydration for the winter months. I intend to keep using it when summer comes, but perhaps adding a toner to control oil.

(Note: for those who've found L'Occitane's Immortelle Precious Cleansing Foam to be too drying, this is a great alternative!)Its ok. Wasnt wowed. Still had makeup on the faceOne of the best cleansing oils I've tried. Leaves skin feeling soft.  Highly recommended. I have tried many cleansing oils and many of the sting my eyes. This one does not. It won't remove all my waterproof mascara but i don't expect anything to, it's a great first step at loosening the waterproof mascara and takes all my other makeup off very easily. Rinses clean with no residue and doesn't strip the skin either, your skin feels clean and soft after. I am one who likes to try different products but this is my third bottle and certainly not my last. When water is added it does get milky, and it will cloud your vision a little before you rinse it off - this doesn't bother me at all as it doesn't irritate my eyes but it might bother some. I've been a loyal fan of Origin's Cleansing Facial Oil for years but didn't want to pay shipping when I needed to order more so I went to my trusty Amazon and searched. L'Occitane Shea Cleansing Oil had great reviews so I gave it a shot. I love this stuff! I even like it better than Origins. It actually gets my eye makeup, waterproof liner and mascara right off! I'm sticking with L'Occitane!So amazing! I had a full makeup face on (beauty balm, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, etc. ) Before bed, I squirted some on my hands and began massaging on to my face. I felt like I was just massaging and smearing my gunky makeup all over my face.... (I even squinted into the mirror a few times... I expected to see mascara streaked across my forehead and eyes) but then I rinsed. There was not a trace of any makeup! Just a nice soft feeling. I have oily, acne-prone skin and it did not make me breakout. Actually my shine was really under control the next morning. Highly recommend!I have been using this product for about three years. It goes on smoothly, rinses off completely and leaves my skin extremely soft. This cleansing oil disappointed me. For the price I was hoping to find something I would love, but it left my skin feeling oily like I had to double cleanse. Also I would get a film in my eyes from using it to take off my eye makeup. I stopped using it on my face and now I'm trying to use it up by cleaning my brushes with it. I received a sample of this in a L'Occitane sample bag. There was several products in there (All of which I loved), but this one took the cake. I've completely radicated face washes, like the Cetaphil face cleanser which I've been using for years, and replaced it entirely with this. My skin LOVES this. Since replacing my makeup wipes + face cleansers with this product, my skin has cleared up, I've had no breakouts, my skin tone is even and bright, no redness, no excessive oilyness, no dry patches, and my skin looks the best it's every looked. I usually wear a full face of make up (Foundation, concealer, mascara, etc. ) and this removes all of my makeup with ease. L'Occitane is a great line, but this face oil takes the cake. It is a little pricey for an everyday face wash, but I feel you can never be too careful when it comes to your skin, especially your face. This product is worth every penny. One pump is all you need so this 6 ounce bottle will last you a very long time. Smells heavenly. Highly, highly recommend. Why I Purchased This Product:
  -wear mascara and eyeliner every day
  -don't like the idea of vigorously scrubbing eyes/face to remove makeup
  -have previously tried dermalogica ""precleanse"" and clinique ""take the day off"" cleansing oil with little satisfaciton

How I Used This Product:
  -one pump was sufficient for my entire face
  -applyed to dry face with slightly wet hands (worked best for me)
  -rinsed away with water
  -followed with regular face wash (checks and balances, by Origins)

How This Product Worked For Me:
  -effortlessly, literally effortlessly, removed black smudges from under eyes and makeup from face
  -feel: silky oil (dry), gentle foam (wet)
  -smell: smooth nutty
  -with once daily use, contains enough to last me for about 4-5 months

Price:
-a little expensive for me (college student) but well worth the qualityLove it!For the price, I'd rather spend it on a cleansing balm. I double cleanse, and I would still have traces of makeup after using this oil. I switched back to a cleansing balm and my face is much cleaner. I think the Boscia make up break up cleansing oil is also much more effective. I love L'Occitane products. this smells nice. leaves my skin feeling nice too. Will purchase again. Nice product. Best cleansing oil I have purchased. It truly cleanses your face and gets ALL your makeup off. I have very dry skin and am 53-years-old, so in saying this it may not be for everyone. I am an honest reviewer and you can not return cosmetics. The fragrance is heavenly and I always love that. I have purchased a few bottles for friends and they love it. Plus, can't beat the price on Amazon. Best cleanser for my face. I have dry to combo type of skin and this is amazing. It removes all makeup even waterproof. I only use one pump and it does a perfect job. Also love the hydrated feeling it leaves once washed off. Not a nasty strippy feeling like other cleansers I've tried in the past. And it doesn't leave my fave oily either. I love this prouduct so much and recommend it everyone. Feels great on my skin and removes Eye makeup like a charm!Excellent productI was curious about this product, I had not heard of an oil cleanser. This product is amazing! I'm so glad I found it. My skin is amazingly smooth and silky. I don't get blemishes, but do have textured skin. Not any more. My skin never feels greasy or oily. Removes my make up very easily. My adult daughter has started using it, I've told the gals at work and they've placed orders. Great buy!! I LOVED it!!Ever since I started using this product, my skin feels so well balanced in terms of oil/dryness.  It removes my makeup and I don't see any trace makeup on my cotton pad when I use my toner.  My skin is so soft and clean even my husband made a comment on it. good so farI love the L'Occitane shea butter line but for some strange reason this cleansing oil completely dried out my skin. So much so that it started to hurt after five days of using. The fact that the oil becomes a milky foam probably requires a certain chemical that my face does not like. GreatThis is a very nice oil. I have sensitive combination skin and it doesn't irritate it. The oil does have a moderately strong fragrance that lingers for about an hour. It contains a strong iris note and perhaps a little rose. Nice face wash, has a bit of scent. Not bad a scent, but distinct similar to baby powder. Love this. slim feels clean but soft. It gets eye makeup off including mascara. I will order this again. This product is amazing. My skin feels refreshed and there's no traces of makeup. I use Bobbi Brown's foundation sticks and find this makeup remover to be great. I even notice a glow!When I saw the product name I thought this was traditional oil cleansing where an oil or oil blend only is applied to a dry face to cleanse. This product is a combination of oils and manmade ingredients which is put onto wet skin. Upon combining with water it turns into a low suds emulsion cleansing solution. It is rinsed off with water then a layer of oil is left clinging to the skin which is a layer of moisturizer.

This has a mild scent which I cannot identify which surprised me as to me L'Occitane is known for very strong fragrance levels. I am fine with the scent as when I add a face lotion with SPF that has a scent and everything else I use is another layer of scent (facial lotions, body lotions, hair styling product, hair spray, anti-perspirant).

Although this was not what I assumed I like it very much. I have sensitive skin with rosacea (on prescription medication and an a food elimination plan). I rate this 5 stars = I Love It. This is a nice cleanser, especially for makeup removal.  It leaves the skin feeling nice and clean but not stripped of all moisture, and it doesn't make my oily skin break out.

Unfortunately, I don't like the synthetic floral scent of this cleanser and the scent is *way* too strong and unlike some other reviewers I did find it to linger sometimes.  If they used the same fragrance but cut the intensity of the scent down to about 25% of what it currently is I would probably give this 4 stars.  If it was fragrance free and slightly cheaper I would definitely give this 5 stars. I asked my girlfriend to try this one out and this is what she said:

I have been wanting to try a cleansing oil for a while now, and because I received this one to review, I thought it would be a good place to start. I normally use eye makeup remover pads and makeup remover wipes to remove my daily makeup and then I have a variety of foamy cleansers/scrubs to wash my face., which I only do in the shower.

At 50, my skin is combination, slightly oily t-zone/dry everywhere else, no blemishes and small to invisible pores. Im not sensitive to products, and use a variety of cleansers and scrubs interchangeably. I wear makeup daily, including full coverage foundation. I use a variety of foundations, often thicker Korean BB creams as I have uneven skin coloration and a mild redness. I don't use waterproof mascara but some of my eyeliners claim to be waterproof.

Im not a fan of washing my face over the sink because no matter what I do, it seems impossible to properly apply and rinse products without water going everywhere all over the bathroom counter and down my neck, etc. Perhaps Im alone in this, but this is why I prefer doing it in the shower. That said, I tried this product while standing at my sink, as it seemed to make sense for the way that it is meant to be used.

This oil is a little thicker than I expected, and to use it the way it is intended, its a bit unsettling if you're not used to rubbing oil all over your face. The smell is tolerable, but because I mostly smell the oil, and not the fragrance. (Its more like the smell of a body moisturizer oil that you would use after bathing. )  The idea is to massage it on to break down makeup, and then to add a bit of water to emulsify it and make it rinsable.

I found that even with concentrated effort to spend time massaging and then emulsifying, and even after rinsing quite a bit, I still ended up with makeup all over my towel and a lot still on my face. Much of my eye makeup smeared around my eyes, which is never the case with my regular eye makeup remover or even just makeup wipes. Maybe a washcloth would work better than just my hands, but I don't normally wash my face with anything but my hands, so I actually have no washcloths to test this theory. I also suspect that by itself, this particular cleansing oil is too drying for my non-oily skin, as oil breaks oil and if you don't have oily skin to begin with, it can strip too much.

I think this cleansing oil might work for me  if I were to use this right before a shower and just go straight to a regular cleanser and better overall rinsing, as I normally would. I won't give up on it totally, but Im not convinced its something that will work for me yet. This is an interesting product and I wanted to try it because the thought of using oil to clean/wash my face is foreign to me.  My face has tended to be oily most of my life so far but is not quite as bad in the last five years
.
I cringed the first time I put this on my face because I assumed it would make my skin break out with pimples or a rash.
I was wrong.
It hasn't bothered my skin nor caused any problems that are abnormal.

I am pleasantly surprised!  I apply the oil to my dry skin and then add a little water which make is lather up slightly.  I make sure that I rinse it well and my skin is clean and soft.  The oil does have a slight scent to it.  The first ingredient is sunflower seed oil and it contains 5% shea butter.

Although my face is seem softer, I have still been applying daily face and eye cream.  I don't believe that this is meant to be a moisturizer, just a wash and makeup remover. I like the handy pump dispenser.  Although this isn't my favorite wash, I will continue to use it and see if it makes any changes in my skin texture or look.

I will see how this product performs over then next few months and comment back if there are any changes. I love the L'Occitane Shea Cleansing oil.  It is strong enough to remove my waterproof mascara, but it doesn't irritate my eyes.  I don't have to rub to get my makeup. Best of all this oil is water soluble so it washes off after you've wiped off the makeup leaving your skin moisturized and fresh feeling.  Smells good too. I've been intrigued with cleansing oils for awhile as they are touted as being able to thoroughly remove makeup without stripping or drying out the skin.  This cleansing oil does just that.  I used two pumps of the oil, rubbed my palms together to warm it up, and then massaged it into dry skin.  I then wet my hands with a little bit of warm water at a time and continued massaging my skin, adding more water until the oil was completely removed.  If you've never used cleansing oils before it's worth reading up on how to use them properly as the experience is a bit different than using a foaming cleanser (though it reminded me a lot of how I use my Glam Glow ThirstyCleanse).  It takes some time to fully see the effect of a product on your skin but so far, I'm enjoying the experience.  Having suffered from acne on and off since my teen years oil was a dirty word for me for a long time, but this product has made me realize it's about adding the right oils into my routine.  I do feel like my skin feels very clean after using this, but doesn't feel stripped, tight or dry like foaming cleansers often make my skin feel.  I think the only downside is it does mean your cleansing routine takes a little bit longer, especially if you are used to facial wipes or very quickly lathering and rinsing your face.  But I've found it's pretty relaxing and like a little luxurious treat at the end of the day.

I would definitely recommend this. I generally love L'Occitane products, and for the most part, their Shea Cleaning Oil is great. As other reviewers say, it feels a little oily going on, but it cleans gently and any trace of oiliness disappears as your face dries. Overall it works well, leaving you feeling clean and without the dry or  harsh feeling you sometimes get with other products. A little goes a long way, so even though it's expensive, it lasts a long time.

About the only thing I don't like is that I feel the fragrance is a bit too strong, but if you like the fragrance, it's definitely worth a try. My wife has really enjoyed this cleanser. She tells me it gently removes her make up and leaves her face felling soft and moisturized. She also says that it seems to be helping prevent her occasional acne breakouts. She highly recommends this product to those with dry skin problems. I am really surprised to be writing anything less than a five star review from l'Occitaine.  But I am.  I have to say that the scent is just far, far too strong for me to use this product on my face, so I only used it the once and I was fairly desperate to get it off my face as soon as possible.  This product did seem to do a good job on my face, but I just can't bear the overwhelming smell first thing in the morning.  I usually use the L'Occitaine Precious Cleansing Foam and I love that product so much - it's perfect.

HOWEVER, I then used it to shave my legs and underarms, and it's absolutely heavenly for that purpose.  My legs, who have been dry and neglected, are silky smooth and lovely right now.  It's perfection as a shaving foam. Really gets makeup off and doesn't over dry skinLittle odd to use oil to remove oil - and after initial use my face still feels oily, BUT it soon dries and leaves skin silky smooth. Love the smell and feel. Another winner from L'Occitane. I got overzealous when I ordered this.  I love L'Occitane products, and failed to notice that this is oil.
Yes, it removes the makeup.  It also leaves behind an oily residue - but that doesn't stay oily for too long and then the skin feels pretty good.  For me, the fragrance is WAY too much for something you are going to put on your face. I have become a fan of cleansing oil despite being skeptical the first time I tried it. It is great for when your skin is dry or more ""mature"" so you don't want to use a cleanser that is too harsh.

I am also generally a fan of the L'Occitane products. This oil does a good job of cleansing and feels very nice.  My only complaint is that it is a bit more scented (it has a flowery perfumey scent) than I would prefer.  The good news is that the scent does not linger so much that I could smell it all night, but I would still prefer less scent.  If not for the scent, I would give this 5 stars.

If you want a good cleansing oil but want less scent, I like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juice-Beauty-Stem-Cellular-Cleansing-Oil-4-fl-oz/dp/B00GTESTLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Cleansing Oil, 4 fl. oz. </a>. A gentle non-drying cleanser that does a good job of removing makeup.

I would have given it 5 stars, but I did not care for the fragrance. Sort of bubblegum, maybe it's me, just didn't wow me. Expected more from L'Occitane in the fragrance department after using their wonderful hand lotions.

Other than that small caveat, it is a very good cleanser, especially for drier or sensitive skin types. Dry, mature skin can suffer from wearing makeup every day, and removing the makeup with harsh cleansers just makes matters worse.

Enter L'Occitane Shea Cleansing Oil. This light, golden-colored oil is long-lasting, easy to use, and effectively removed my tinted moisturizer, concealer, and blush.

To use it, I wet my face and use one pump of the oil to cover and cleanse my face. Then I rinse thoroughly. All traces of my makeup are removed. (I don't use waterproof makeup, but the directions say the product will remove even waterproof makeup. )

The scent of the product is subtle and pleasant but does not linger when rinsed off. It contains 5% Shea oil, along with sunflower oil, but no ""scary"" chemicals.

After use, my face is almost smooth enough to skip moisturizer. (I don't skip it, but others might be able to. )

Even at the price of $22 for 6. 7 fl. oz., this is worth trying. A bottle will last you quite a while (used once daily, as I do), and like me, you'll probably want to keep on using it. Like the other L'Occitane products I have tried, this cleansing oil is a winner!  You use it along with warm water, and it makes itself into a very effective, gentle and hardworking cleaning foam.  It feels just a little bit tingly going on, but you can also feel the nice hint of shea in it, which keeps it from making the skin dry at all.  My face feels totally clean and soft after using it.  I don't use a lot of make-up, but I put some on to take it off, some foundation, and it worked extremely well.  I might wear more foundation in the future, as I like to wear it, but other cleansers didn't always get it off completely, which I need, as I have rosacea.  If this has any scent, it's extremely mild, so no worries there.

I love the elegant look of this product too!  It can be left out in the bathroom as it just looks nice.  Highly recommended!I got this for my girlfriend to try because she loves the various Shea Butter hand creams that L'Occitane makes. Each year for Christmas I get her one of their sets with lots of different scents in it and she never seems to use anything else.

This seemed like a natural, but she was hesitant at first as it apparently has very little Shea Butter in it but she still thought it might be too oily as she doesn't have dry skin. However, she thinks it works just fine, cleans without drying her face, and she was pleased that it washes away easily and doesn't seem to leave any oil. This cleansing oil works surprisingly well.  After using it the first week my face does felt clean yet hydrated, not like other harsh soaps.  I did needed to rub a bit more or use extra oil to remove my eye make up but other than that is works great.  My lotions, foundations etc came off fairly easily and when I dried my face on my towel I don't see any make-up residue!
The only problem is that I have allergies.  At first I didn't mind the faint baby powder smell.  But I notice the more I use the product the more it is starting to bother me.  My eyes and nose feel a little irritated and now my skin is starting to feel uncomfortable.  My skin is clean but doesn't feel clean.  Because of this I stopped using it regularly and after use I wash it off thoroughly with warm water.  But even after that my skin is still soft.  I think due to my reaction I will have to discontinue use it soon.  Which is such a shame!  But for people who aren't really sensitive I think this is a great alternative to the other soaps on the market which are abrasive and strip your skin.  If this came in a fragrance free or another company had something of this quality which was hypoallergenic I would be purchasing it in a heart beat!I have never used oils of any kind on my face so I was very curious about this.  I have always been taught that the idea was to keep oils OFF my face.  Oils clog pores--yes?  However, that was extremely short sighted.  I love how this Cleansing oil leaves my face feeling all soft and clean.

My skin feels amazing.  I know better than to touch, butits hard not to.

This is also an extremely effective makeup remover.  My only makeup is generally mascara which sometimes feels like shoe polish coming off.  This product removed mascara without scrubbing and rescrubbing.  That may cause me to wear makeup more often.  Maybe not. I have somewhat sensitive skin, but this cleanser did not cause any irritation.  It has a nice, clean scent, that is not overpowering, but pleasant.  It left my T-zone clean and soft.  It says specifically that it is good on waterproof makeup and around eyes, but on my waterproof mascara, it did not take it all off. Like others, I have mixed feelings about this cleansing oil. I do like how it takes off my makeup. It helps break down my foundation so it comes off cleaner. What I'm so-so on is how my skin feels after using it. My skin tends to still feel pretty oily, although I'm not sure everyone will have the same result.

I'm wondering if the lingering oily feeling on my skin could be a result of what happens when one uses this cleanser with softened water. Some people mention they find it washes away cleanly, while others feel it leaves an oily residue. I'm wondering if those of us who feel their skin is still pretty oily after using it might be users who also have softened water.

I am still using this cleanser because I do like how well it takes off my color-stay foundation, but I also then rinse my face with a quick wash from a foam face cleanser I have as well. To take away the last bit of oily feeling left behind. This oil and emulsifier based cleanser removes all traces of makeup and does not leave skin feeling stripped.  It is an impressive makeup remover.

I have issues with the aesthetics, though.  The first time I used it, I kept wondering when it would start to foam because it felt like I was still rubbing oil and water on my skin.  I finally opened my eyes and glanced in the mirror to find it was indeed foaming.  I can't feel it changing on my face or with my fingertips.  I've used it a good two weeks now, and that hasn't changed.  I know that after I add water, it will start foaming, but I can't tell when that happens.  It is impossible to rinse off unless I use a washcloth.  I can see the makeup is gone, but water beads up on my face.  I appreciate the softness, but I really don't like leaving cleanser on my face, so I scrape it off with a wash cloth.

Yesterday, I noticed the ""Safe For"" symbol on the back of the bottle.  This symbol looks like a jar, and has a number followed by the letter ""M"".  This symbol is not on all cosmetic and personal care consumables, but I find it more and more often.  Unfortunately, according to the ""Safe For"" symbol on this bottle, the cleanser is safe to use for a mere three months after opening.  I think the average consumer will wind up wasting a lot of product.  Exceptions would be multi-user households. After a week of use, I'm not sure I can really tell a difference from my normal routine.  I would definitely not pay the current price of $22I was quite skeptical about the claims that an oil based product could effectively cleanse my facial skin, but I have to admit that it really works well ! Just add a small squirt into the palm of the hand, add a little water, work gently into a lather, apply liberally to the face, then rinse off. It didn't sting my eyes at all, and washed away every bit of my waterproof mascara. To test how clean my skin was, I used some clarifying lotion on a cotton pad and found no trace of makeup on the pad. I found the scent a bit off-putting though - it smells like you're rubbing salad oil onto your face. Though I'm not a fan of overly perfumed products, it seems that in this case, a bit of added scent might have been helpful. The oil washes off easily, leaving no detectable residue, so I applied my usual moisturizer afterwards.

According to the label all contents are ""natural origin ingredients"", and the primary ingredient is sunflower seed oil. It cuts through make-up or grease/oil leaving your skin feel smooth and clean. I would prefer if it didn't smell like baby powder though. This is a weird switch for me, having had oily skin most of my life and believing that more oil is bad.  Now that I'm older, my skin is drier, but even someone WITH oily skin may want to try this. It feels lovely.

I did an exfoliation first (my Sunday night thing) and then washed up with this.  Left it on a second an massaged it in.  Rinsed clean but with a lovely soft feeling.  After this I did my serum, night cream, and moisturizer.  I don't always do that series, as I usually fall into bed with my teeth brushed and not much else done to my face.  But on a good night I will take the time.  This was definitely a nice treat.

I liked especially that it didn't have an obnoxious overpowering scent (instead, no scent at all).  The bottle is large but a little will go a long way so it's worth it's price.

I did knock a star off because dispensing it was impossible with the pump. I had to get my glasses to read the tiny letters on the top and still couldn't figure out how the pump works so I just took the whole lid thing off and poured a bit in my hand.  Not cool.

For what it's worth, L'Occitane makes an Almond Shower Gel that is amazing.  Super soft too. Given the term ""cleansing oil"" I rather expected this to be a general facial cleanser, but that may just be my mistake. I didn't find it to work well as a general cleanser at all. Although it creates a nice, muted foam that has a laudable texture, it doesn't completely wash off. My skin decidedly felt far too oily after using this, unless I used a different cleanser/soap to wash it off.

That said, it did a pretty good job as just a makeup remover. I could easily see sticking this on your bathroom sink and pumping a little onto a cotton ball or pad at night to wipe off one's makeup with before washing your face. It did a good job of removing mascara, eyeshadow, etc. (though nothing I was wearing was waterproof, so I can't speak to that specifically). It's worth noting that it did not perform better than straight coconut oil in that respect, however, which is much cheaper.

I'm ambivalent about the scent. I usually like L'Occitane's scents, but this one didn't quite work for me. It's not obnoxious or overbearing, but there's something off about it. It seemed okay when I first opened it and gave a sniff, but I noticed when I went to use it at night that it didn't tend to agree with me as much. Just personal preference there, but I think the scent would be enough to dissuade me from picking it up again. It would be worth your while to try to find this in person somewhere and give it a sniff before you invest. I was very excited to try this.  I've long wanted to try the Shu Uemura or Rodin facial cleansing oils, but they're just so darned expensive.  In recent years, the market seems to have been flooded with similar products at all price points but, with the exception of several free samples from the Japanese company DHC, I've still never bothered to pick one up.  I usually remove my eye make-up with Cetaphil and cleanse the rest of my face with an exfoliating product, so I've never felt the urge to stray from what works for me.  But since this was being offered as a free trial, I figured why not?

When it arrived, I immediately opened it and squirted a bit on my fingers.  My first impression was that it reminded me a bit of baby oil - the fragrance and consistency.  Very different than the DHC oil which was light and almost odorless.  Not off to a good start.  However, once activated with water the oil easily emulsified into a thin, slippery fluid and created a low grade lather that felt nice and rinsed easily.  My skin felt smooth, firm and moisturized afterward.  I was sold.

But the story doesn't end there.

After two days use, I noticed a number of clogged pores and two blemishes.  Now, I haven't had a blemish in years.  Years and years and years.  I honestly thought that any concern over zits was well behind me at this point, but I suppose I've just been using the right cosmetics and treatment products.  I tried the oil for one more night before finally calling it quits.  This seems like a high quality item and it may work for some, but I'm too old to be dealing with breakouts. This is a non-foaming cleansing oil that works okay, but doesn't really take off mascara very easily, even non-waterproof mascara. I don't wear much makeup (a mineral foundation, some blush, a coat of mascara) and even after using this product like a wash (using my hands), some of my makeup remained and I had to use some on a cotton ball to get off the rest of it. It has an odd odor (perhaps the Shea oil) that I didn't particularly care for and it didn't leave my skin feeling clean. I have combination skin and I do enjoy a nice scrubbed face, so it might just be that this product and I are not a good fit. It would probably be nice for people with extremely sensitive or dry skin, but it sure didn't work for me. I regularly use oil to cleanse my face so I was happy to see a blend by a well-known skin care company available for purchase.  The primary oil in this blend is sunflower seed oil, a good choice for skin health with some properties that are especially good for acne-prone skin.  This oil is light and becomes creamy with the addition of water; it is noticeably easier to rinse off compared to my own oil blend.  With my blend I hold a wet, hot washcloth over my face for several minutes and while this cleansing oil doesn't require that step, I find it is so pleasant I usually still do it.  The other side to that is if I'm in a hurry this is easy to massage on and rinse off quickly.  My skin is left feeling clean and supple, though I do usually apply a light moisturizer anyway.  I don't love the fragrance of this product; it smells like baby powder.  It isn't necessarily unpleasant, it just isn't something I prefer.  (I do like the Braille on the label - that's fun to feel and show to my kids!)I love this!I will never use another cleanser!!! This stuff is non-foaming, moisturizing, and does a wonderful job at removing all makeup, even liquid liner and mascara.  It feels so lovely as you massage onto your dry face, and then melts away makeup and dirt as you add a little water. I wipe off with a warm, wet washcloth. Super easy and feels great! This product also doesn't create waste like makeup wipes, and I use less water then with foaming cleansers. One bottle lasts me for 6 months!!!Its a good product and does a good job of removing makeup and sunscreen from the day. A little spendy and I might look for another one that is less expensive to see if they work as well. Favorite cleanser ever. Doesnt dry out my skin, which I love. Great face wash for combination skin. Helps control dryness & oil. Removes your makeup without making your skin feel dry or chapped like makeup remover wipes and some cleansers do. My skin actually feels relieved after using it. I also feels like it does a better job of really getting into my pores to remove debris than other cleansers. I really like the scent.

It smelled nice but man, what a bummer!!!I have been using this oil and soap for years.  It leaves my face spotless and is great if you have dry skinThis product cleans my skin well,and removes makeup. It leaves my skin feeling smooth. Does not take too much product which is good because it is pricey for me!I saw this pre-cleansing oil in a beauty article and supposedly it was the next big beauty scope so I forked up the price to give it a try. I was experiencing really dry winter skin and had some flaky parts. This oil is thick and it is liquid lard for your face, plus it smells fabulous. I massage it into my face and then add my regular cleanser like it was suggested in the article I read. Here is where it gets tricky, just water and cleanser will not remove this oil, I don't know if it would due different using a soap from the same Erno Lazlo brand but the way to take it off is with cotton pads. It did seem like a lot of grime/makeup residue came off and still my skin was super soft after using the cotton pads. My flaky skin did go away and overall my skin seems to be moist. The reason I didn't give it the 5 stars is because of the fact that you have to remove it with a cleanser, warm water and cotton pads or have to deal with a lot of product buildup. For the price I think I'll skip buying git again but this oil will last a long time since a little does go a long way. This is a great product.  I've used it for forty years.  In the winter when my skin gets dry, I put it on at night and let it soak in. I've been using this for 35 years now. It's great for dry skin. as part of her daily regimen, my wife uses Laszlo only and it showsThis is a great product that I have been using for a long time. I highly recommend it
as a great cleansing oil. I started using Erno Laszlo back in the 70's when I had a lot of problems with my skin  Then I drifted away, especially living on the frontier of New Mexico.  Now at 66 I'm beginning to see the signs of aging on my face (luckily they are smile wrinkles but I don't like them.  I switched back to EL about a month ago and love the results.

size however most of the bottles leaked during shipping.  Not much was lost and I rinsed the bottles in hot
water and they were fine.  I was very happy with the purchase and ordered it again. Laslo is a great skin care line -- possibly the only really great skin care line out there. I worked in a spa for 10 years and Dermalogica Precleanse was the best pre cleanser makeup remover, followed by a skin cleaner with a clarisonic. I wanted to try this Erno Laszlo product and I'm grateful for amazons return policy as I sent it back. This clogged my pores terribly. Mineral oil is never good on your facial skin. I followed the directions for application but my face did not appreciate it. Dermalogica Precleanse leaves my skin perfectly cleansed every time. Use it before cleansing each evening for a very moisturized result. Its Great!!

4,0.9735171424933777,B019QSK1YG,B0032Z24JU,B0032Z24JU,"Natura Bisse The Cure All in One Cleanser, 5.3 Oz","Face feels great afterBest cleaner ever. Keeps skin looking young. Top notch. Works great. Feels good. As good as they come. Creamy and smooth, this cleanser does a great job removing makeup.  I don't wear a lot, but it removes every speck.  I haven't used it long enough to notice any long term skin benefits, so I can't say much about that.  This does seem to be far more expensive than some very similar products that are creamy and remove makeup without drying your skin.  I haven't experienced any break outs or irritation, which is a plus.  It is creamy during use, rinses completely and leaves my skin feeling soft without an oily residue.  If you are budget conscious you will likely want to keep looking, but this is nice. I have dry, sensitive skin. This all-in-one cleanser is wonderfully hydrating and removes every bit of make-up, certainly better than any cleanser I've used, especially micellar water. It removes waterproof mascara and hasn't irritated my eyes whatsoever. It leaves my dry skin feeling like I've used a moisturizer. It's kind of pricey for a cleanser, but you need very little, so the 5. 3 ounce tube should last a long time. Really nice cleanser that helps with film/studio HD make-up products. It seems to have a firming action as well - an unexpected gift! I found the under-eye area had what looked to be a significant effect, in just 5 applications.

Since I started in the industry, on-camera and off the #1 skin-care 'secret' is simply keeping your skin CLEAN.  Just because 'you can'  skip this every morning and (particularly) at night, you must NEVER do such things!

Natura Bisse The Cure All in One Cleanser is the real deal, be it for men or women.  The HD make-up used in TV and film has terrific coverage but can be harsh and blocking to the skin  This is my new go-to!This Natura Bisse cleans the face well and is gentle and non-irritating.  It works well if you massage just a little onto a wet face with your fingers.  It works even better if you have one of those battery charged brush.  Its very gentle for the eye area which I always worry about.  Its almost fragrance free  just a little fresh background. When its rinsed off your skin feels clean with no oily residue. Either I am using Natura Bisse The Cure All-in-One Cleanser incorrectly or I am simply not impressed with performance of the 1-oz. tube I received.  Yes, it had a pleasant, light but undefinable fragrance.  Yes, it left my skin feeling soft.  Was I confident it cleansed my skin completely - no.  Was it any more effective than the much more reasonably priced Ponds Cold Cream - no.  If you are impressed by luxury brands, you may like this better than I did - otherwise look for other facial cleansers. Wow!  For a cleanser, this product really makes my skin feel soft and moisturized!

I love the slightly floral fragrance.  It's very feminine.  It's a nice soapy smell.

It definitely removes makeup without difficulty and has my skin feeling so baby soft - I don't feel like I need to ad a moisturizer or night cream after use.

Definitely a cut above any cleansers I have tried. Love this stuff. It really removes all make-up and dirt and leaves face feeling good. I swear by this cleanser- I use far less moisturizer with this cleanser, and yet it leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.  Brilliant product. I have an independent spa retailer if anyone wants natura bisse for the low... totally legit. This cleanser came with no directions. I first attempted to use it on dry skin and it did not remove my make up. Next I wet my skin and applied the remover and cleaned up by rinsing, still had makeup on my face. Finally, I used a cleansing brush and washcloth to remove all traces of makeup. Honestly make up wipes are easier. This is the best face cleanser I have ever used. The texture is creamy and smooth with white color and mild scent. I used it to clean my face with powdery foundation and it removed everything, left my face skin soft and moisturizer. I am amazed. Imagining that cleaning face is a luxury experience, that is how I feel. I don't need moisturizer anymore because this cleanser has essential oils Which moisturize and ensure that the skin is not damaged as you cleanse. The only concern is it is quite pricey, but it worth it. I was not overly impressed with this cleanser (especially at this price). It was pretty creamy and doesn't really lather which made me feel like I needed to use a lot of it to get coverage on my face. It made my face feel clean but I didn't think it was overly special. Easy to use and removed makeup thoroughly.  Non-greasy, light pleasant scent. Treats my 50+ year old skin gently whether removing what's left of my makeup at the end of a work day, or the end of an evening out, or when I want to treat my skin nicely before I go to sleep. I really have noticed my skin and eyes feel better especially during pollen season where the non-native scotch broom pollen creates havoc with the eyes and sinus. This nonlathering cleanser reminded me of hand lotion, probably because the fragrance reminded me of hand lotion I have used in the past.  It works great to remove makeup but after about 2 weeks I noticed my face started breaking out and my skin is not considered oily by nature.  I switched back to my regular face cleanser and my skin cleared back up.  So, if your skin is oily or prone to breakouts this might not be the cleanser for you. I love this cleanser!  It does what it says it will do---cleans the face extremely well.  I've been using it at night for a while now, and my face just feels better---like it's been deep-cleaned, but also, as advertised, softer and smoother.  A little goes a long way, and it goes on easily and washes off well.  I've been truly impressed with how I can actually feel the difference in my skin.  I am often skeptical of products like this, so it takes quite a bit to impress me.

Another thing I just love about this is the scent.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but it has a comforting, nostalgic scent.  It might be like something my mother used when I was growing up, because it takes me back every time I smell it---makes me feel somehow safe and taken care of.  I don't usually go on about a scent, but this one is so powerful (not in that it's too strong, not at all!) that I had to.

A great product!I review a lot of different moisterizers and anti-aging creams and lotions and I try not to let cost factor into my rating.  I say that because I think a product review should really just reflect on whether or not a product does what it says it can do.

To that, this cleanser is fantastic. Natura Bisse is one of my top two favorite product-lines and this cleanser is just another example of why. Its very creamy and soothing and your face will actually feel moisturized after washing; just the opposite of many effective facial cleansers. I personally use the Natur Bisse Diamond Extreme afterwards and between the two, I have seen a big difference and my face has never felt so smooth. Im just that impressed with them.

Do note though that this is an expensive product. Also know that I personally use quite a bit to clean my face and neck so its going to be pricy to keep this up.

Recommended. Great Stuff. I've reached that point where my facial skin is pretty dry whether I'm in the humidity of summer or the dry months of winter. Soap, obviously, isn't a great idea for cleaning since it tends to simply make that worse. This particular cleanser is a white cream that is easily spread over my dampened face, then gently scrubbed, leaving my face clean and feeling soft throughout the day. It's somewhat expensive but as others have noted, you don't need to use a lot at each application. Still, this tube probably won't last much longer than a month or two if used twice a day. There's no particular scent that stands out. I've noticed no rash or irritation. It can be easily followed by serum/moisturizer/sunblock or simply used on its own. This cleanser is made in Spain and is wonderful.  It's super creamy and moisturizing, and, as far as I can tell, it is removing all of my Dermablend foundation. It also has a light rosewater scent.  I absolutely love it and will be so sad when the tube is empty. Because there is no way I'd spend $60 on a facial cleanser, unless I won the lottery.
