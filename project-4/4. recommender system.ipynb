      "Get glowing in two easy steps: step 1: cleanse with love your bare face hydrating cleansing oil. Pump a liberal amount into dry hands and massage over dry face to instantly dissolve makeup, dirt, and impurities. Enriched with a blend of grape seed oil that soothes skin and tightens pores, grapefruit peel oil cleanses and evens skin tone, rosehip seed oil hydrates and restores ph balance, and green coffee bean oil invigorates and promotes cell turnover. In a consumer use study, 91 percent of participants agreed bare face cleansing oil leaves their skin softer; 94 percent reported there was no oily residue after using bare face; and 97 percent agreed bare face cleansing oil did not irritate skin. Step 2: exfoliate with charcoal konjac sponge. Dampen sponge and rub gently in a circular motion to slough, smooth, and clean. Use warm water to rinse face and wash away cleansing oil. Made for daily use. Konjac root gently exfoliates and stimulates blood circulation while charcoal powder detoxifies and cleans deep within your pores. At Julep, we celebrate Brave Pretty. Try any trend  no judgments, no fear. Our award-winning products hold our \"Girlfriend's Promise\": simplified, good for you, and no makeup artist required.
