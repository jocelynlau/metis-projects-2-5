used in conjunction with the Peel, seemed to minimize the fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth.', 'It seemed to brighten and tighten my skin.', 'This comes in a tiny bottle.', 'Green Apple SPF 15 and Age Defy Moisturizers - I liked both of these.', \"They were good moisturizers and did not leave my face feeling greasy, which I can't stand.\", 'Green Apple Peel - This peel had a slight odor which was unpleasant.', 'It was not overpowering, though.', 'The peel did make my face burn a tiny bit, during and after removing it.', 'However, it did improve the appearance of my fine lines and overall complexion.', 'Overall, I liked this set.', 'However, several of the bottles are so small, particularly the Age Defy Serum at .', '5 oz, that you will not get that many uses out of them

each item to test them thoroughly.', 'I also love the fact that this come with a day and night moisturizer.', 'The moisturizers and the serum go on smooth, but do not feel greasy or heavy.', 'The cleanser is perfect for an everyday cleanser and does not seem to clog pores.', 'I was real excited to order this product.', 'I have always had good looking skin, but as I grow older, I notice dry skin and fine lines developing.', 'I like this travel size and received the kit just in time for my trip to Hawaii.', 'After a week of use, I really like the results.', 'The product has a clean fresh smell and is organic as well.', 'I really like the way my face feels after I use it.', 'It is a great skin product.', 'I am over 50 and find these products to me gentle and helpful.', 'The full strength peel, which you are only supposed to do once a week, is definitely powerful.', 'It tingles on the skin and my skin was a bit red afterward.', 'But it helped with my enlarged pores and evened the color out (after the redness died down - several hours, so do this at night before bed).', \"The moisturizers are good, but not anything to shout about and the serum may be doing something but I'm not sure yet.\", \"Unfortunately the applicator for the serum doesn't work, so I open the bottle each time and dab some on my finger to apply to my face.\", 'The apple scent is very light and pleasant.', 'This kit is the perfect size for traveling.', 'The facial cleanser is 3.', '5 oz, with the rest significantly smaller.', 'I used the collection for a week to see how it went.', 'My skin is usually dry and winter makes it worse.', 'What I notice with this kit is that my skin felt tighter and drier.', \"Not noticeably so, but enough that I'll keep it for traveling, but not day to day

absorb into the skin much better than these two Green Apple products do.', 'So my bottom-line opinion is that this kit is not a necessary addition to my bathroom cabinet.', \"I'm happy enough with the peel but am just as happy with a good scrub product.\", 'And as for the moisturizers here, they\\'re a \"No, thank you, I have my own favorites already. \"', 'However, a Juice Beauty product that I am

merit, your face does not feel tight after using it.', 'My face feels great..... soft, looks extra clean.', 'The set fell short of 5 stars for a couple of reasons.', 'The first is, that I really did not care for the smell at all.', \"Thankfully, it's not very strong, so it would likely not be a reason to discontinue using the product.\", 'The other part of the line that I did not care for was the moisturizer.', 'It was very thick, and tough to blend in.', 'Many times I left the house with clumps of white moisturizer on my face that I was unaware of.', 'Overall, happy with the product and the results.', \"DYBI've been using this kit for a few weeks and am surprised and pleased that it works for me, an almost 60 fair skinned woman.\", 'Not to sound like an ad, I can already see a difference

buying the products in the larger size.\", 'This kit will probably last 5-6 weeks.', \"I've been using it twice daily as directed for two weeks and can easily go another 2 weeks if not more.\", 'Face cleanser:  I like the slight scent which fades rapidly.', \"It's a rather loose liquid, I only use about a quarter tsp for face, neck and decolletage.\", 'Slight tingle during use.', 'Serum:  this is a heavier gel, I apply and wait a few minutes before using moisturizer.', 'I find that it absorbs into my skin.', 'My face does not feel tight or greasy at all.', 'Moisturizers:  I use the SPF during the day.', 'I find this takes a few minutes to absorb into my skin.', 'I use the regular moisturizer in the evening and that seems to absorb more quickly.', \"However, for me - it takes a few minutes

can't stand.\", \"I'd recommend this kit if you're looking to get a good samples size to try out for a month.\", 'In fact, I have recommended it to a few friends.', 'I previously used products by NuSkin, which are more expensive than these.', \"I did notice the slightest  red of my face the first few days I used the cleansing gel... but I don't anymore.\", \"I'm trying to switch to all organic products for skin and body care and these certainly fit the bill.\", 'Sample or travel sizes.', 'Love the scent, and although have reactive skin do not find these irritating.', 'Cleanser, Age Defy Moisturizer, sunscreen, serum and full strength peel.', 'Overpriced considering how little product you get, and do most people use or need so many different things in their routine?What I like best about this Juice Beauty Age Defying Solutions Kit, is that you can test out 5 products, without having to buy each product separately.', 'The Age Defy Serum alone is $52.', '00 and the Apple Peel is $45.', \"00- that's $97.\", '00 for only 2 of these 5 items, making this a great deal to try out 5 items for $39.', '00.', 'These are small, but larger than sample sizes that will last you about a month and a half, that are worth buying, so you can find out which products actually works for you before spending the bigger cash for the full sizes- and you will find something you like in this kit, as I and everyone I know has.', 'Some of these products are really spa quality great.', 'I have a combination skin type- some dry spots, some oily- nothing extreme, but I can testify to how these products affect both oily or dry skin.', 'I think it easiest to give a description of each of these 5 products to attest to how effective they were for me.', 'GREEN APPLE CLEANSING GEL- This cleansing gel both deeply cleans and exfoliates your skin.', \"With lemon, apple and sugar cane hydroxy acids, you'll feel the deep cleaning, yet with no redness or irritations.\", 'The best part of this cleansing, is that it is neither dry or greasy, leaving your skin feel simply clean and smooth.', 'The results were excellent rating 4 1/2 Stars.', 'GREEN APPLE AGE DEFY SERUM- This serum pumps out of a bottle, and states to use it after the cleansing gel to firm and brighten your skin and reduce fine lines.', 'I found that other face serums/products will do the same thing for way less money.', \"The thing I didn't like about this serum, is that it just doesn't blend into my skin well, due to the texture being so thick/shiny- it just sat on my skin.\", 'This is just an average serum that reduces fine lines as well as my cheaper overnight face creams/serums, so for that I give it 4 Stars.', 'GREEN APPLE PEEL FULL STRENGTH- This peel is simple- after cleaning your face well, apply a good layer to your face, leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse really well.', 'This peel will exfoliate your dead skin just as well as any high priced spa treatment.', 'Your face will tingle and turn red, so you will only want to use this before bed.', \"You don't want to use this before going out, as the tingling and redness take a few hours to go away.\", 'This product is colorless.', 'You will not believe your skin after this treatment- it smoothed out my dry and oily patches!', 'My entire skin was as smooth as silk!', 'This is the BEST rinse off peel ever and deserves 5 Stars.', 'To get your skin feeling this perfect, you would have to go to an upscale spa/salon.', \"GREEN APPLE SPF 15 MOISTURIZER- This moisturizer is for daily use, especially protective from the sun's rays with it's Zinc Oxide protection.\", 'I can see this being a great product for anyone with really dry skin, because it has a really greasy and heavy texture, but for me with just average skin, it is simply too greasy, so I have to give it an average 4 Stars.', \"GREEN APPLE AGE DEFY MOISTURIZER- This moisturizer states it both firms and reduces wrinkles, but again, I didn't see it do anything different that any of my much cheaper moisturizers do.\", \"Like the Age Defy Serum, it also doesn't blend into my skin very well- another product that seems to sit on top of my skin.\", 'I found this to be a very average moisturizer, that I can get cheaper with other products, so for that reason it gets an average 4 Stars.', 'I wish Juice Beauty had included a small size of their Stem Cellular Repair Eye Treatment with this Kit.', 'This Eye Treatment is another high upscale Spa type treatment that leaves you feeling and looking fresh, smooth and fabulous, like their Peels and Cleansers.', \"I love the fact that Juice Beauty's products are made with organic ingredients and anti-oxidants and especially with Co-Q10.\", 'Co-Q10 replaces oxygen in every cell in your body, and that keeps your cells moving and healthy.', \"Overall, this is a great introduction to Juice Beauty's products and you will definitely find something great in this kit like I did, earning this Kit 4 1/2 Stars.\", 'When I first received the Age Defy Solutions, I was a bit disappointed when I opened the package and it was what I call \"trial size\" bottles.', 'I hate it when products have $69 value for $39 when, in fact, there is only about $25 worth of product in the entire package.', \"I honestly don't know how you are expected to see if a product works when you only receive about one week's worth of actual product.\", 'For my review, I used all the products twice a day as recommended, the Apple peel being the only product I used once as you use it only once a week.', '1.', 'Green Apple Cleansing Gel:  The first thing that happened when I opened the tube to use the cleanser, it was extremely liquid like water, it shot right out all over my hand and counter top.', 'The cleanser either needs to be thicker or they need a smaller opening.', 'Secondly, it smelled like Lemon Pledge.', \"I don't know where the Green Apple comes into play as I walked around for two days with that Lemon Pledge smell in my nose.\", 'Also, I noticed it is extremely gentle.', 'Yes, you want your cleanser to be gentle, but you also want it to clean.', \"It didn't clean off the red marks left on my lips from a flavored bottled water in black raspberry that I drink frequently.\", 'I scrubbed and scrubbed and still red marks, so I had to use my regular cleanser to get them off.', 'Also, it barely cleaned off my eye liner and mascara.', \"To top it off, seven days into using the product, I have a break-out and I haven't had one in months.\", '2.', 'The Exfoliant Peel I liked quite a bit.', 'My skin felt really clean and smooth.', '3.', \"The Age Defy Serum I also liked but it didn't even last seven days, but it burned my face.\", '4.', 'Green Apple Moisturizer: This is the product I hated the most.', 'It was like spreading cement onto your skin and having to use a trowel to smear it around.', 'It did not absorb into the skin.', 'It took quite a bit of tugging to even get it to spread onto my face.', \"Frankly, I don't like having to pull on my skin to get a moisturizer to blend in.\", 'I hated it so much that after four days of twice a day, I said enough and quit using it.', 'This is a horrible moisturizer.', 'I have never used something with this tough texture.', 'I hated it.', '5.', \"Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer:  I liked the moisturizer fairly well, but for a night time moisturizer, for my age, (middle 50's) it wasn't thick enough.\", 'When I smoothed it onto my skin it became even thinner and turned white like a thin lotion.', 'But I did like how my skin looked after I used it.', 'However, after the serum and the moisturizer, my neck and cheeks were red and my skin burned for quite some time after use.', 'To sum my review up, I would not buy these products ever again, nor would I recommend these products.', 'They aren\\'t \"user friendly\" and definitely are not worth the price tag.', 'I am not super impressed with the product.', 'The pump mechanism on the age defying serum was broken making it so I was unable to even try it.', \"The rest of the kit worked fine but I wasn't a fan of the smell.\", \"It wasn't very pleasant and almost had a chemical smell to them.\", \"The face wash doesn't lather up much which would take some getting used to.\", \"After using it my skin felt ok but I didn't notice any spectacular results.\", 'I will probably use it as a travel set as it is a nice compact size.', \"This is a great kit, but the thing to remember is that the items are sample sizes so they're not very big.\", 'These products are organic which is a huge plus.', 'The sunscreen for example uses zinc oxide as opposed to the other harmful chemicals that other sunscreens use.', 'The products are good.', \"We expected them to smell a little more like green apple since that's what's on the box and the packaging.\", \"The day moisturizer is thick, so it's a little hard to get out of the bottle.\", \"Other than that, it's a great set to try out the juice beauty products.\", 'This is nice little starter kit of Juice Beauty skin solutions to keep signs of aging at bay.', 'I especially like the Cleansing Gel.', 'It makes my skin soft and clean.', \"(I've recently tried the Stem Cellular Cleansing Oil-which I like too, but use it less often) The moisturizers are good--nothing special, but one is to use at night and one during the day.\", 'The Age Defy Serum needs to be applied sparingly, but it feels nice and cool, not greasy.', \"The only thing I haven't tried is the Full Strength Peel, which I'll try this weekend and update review.\", \"Overall, I'm really happy with this product line.\", 'At my age, I like all the help I can get.', \"My reason for four stars (not five) is because I don't think the products have a very good scent.\", \"Others have mentioned citrus scent, but I don't smell that at all... just kind of medicinal.\", 'Overall, great products that I recommend.', 'Update: I tried the mask.', \"It didn't give any kind of irritation or redness to my skin.\", 'My face feels soft.', \"I'm officially a fan of Juice all natural skin oroducts.\", 'I\\'ve been using the daily moisturizer, the blemish peel and the sensitive skin peel for several weeks now and my \"fair sensitive breaks out over everything\" skin looks outstanding.', \"I've gotten 1-2 comments a day in the last few weeks about how radiant I look.\", 'Really does something for the self-esteem for us women of a certain age to hear that!', 'This kit includes an \"age defy serum\" which goes on like a light gel and is worn under your moisturizer.', 'I have noticed in the last two weeks my skin has felt really dry and tight, this has made a big difference.', 'I wish they made all over body serum like this!', 'I think this would make a great gift for someone who would appreciate a higher end skin product, but I took off one star because the sizes you get with this are small sample size, not full size and I think that they are priced too high for it to be a good deal.', \"I'd pay $20 for this and feel like I was giving a very nice gift without breaking the bank.\", 'I have used a few Juice Beauty products, but this is my first time using a whole system of products that are designed to work together.', \"Even though I have been using Retin-A, this kit works well with my skin and I haven't experienced any irritation, not even with the peel.\", 'In fact, the peel cleared up some dry patches caused by the retinoid (and the dry Fall weather) it gave my skin a soft and glowing even tone.', \"Wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable and I'm sure they will improve more as time goes on... with using the products regularly.\", 'My favorites in this kit are the peel, the serum, and the \"age defy\" moisturizer.', 'My skin drank up the moisturizer even though it felt a bit heavier than the day cream (with spf).', 'The day cream does have a slight \"whitening\" effect (due to titanium dioxide) and may be visible on darker complexions, especially if not worn under makeup.', 'Using less, allowing it to \"soak in a bit\" or rubbing into the skin a bit more may help correct this.', 'I mixed some of the age defy moisturizer to diffuse it, I most likely lost some SPF by doing this but it looked better on my skin.', 'The serum is awesome, particularly around the eyes.', 'The goal of this kit is to help the cells turn over and reveal softer and more even toned complexion.', 'It works perfectly in this regard as a low level AHA & BHA peel (with supporting products) that can be used by all skin types, except, perhaps... more sensitive skin.', \"I'm very pleased with the results, and intend to at least continue using the peel and the moisturizer when this kit is finished.\", 'I love how my skin feels, the new glow I have, and the ease of applying makeup.', 'Highly recommended!I started paying more attention to my skin particularly my face this year...', 'I started early in the year with a professional chemical peel and after seeing/feeling the difference I decided to stay on top of my skincare (I was under the false impression I was too young to be bothered with it).', 'The Juice Beauty Age Defying Solutions Kit and the line in general is definitely above average and fairly priced.', 'I find it gently exfoliates, tightens, brightens and smoothes my skin.', 'I will definitely be using it again.', 'It helps me maintain clear and soft skin.', 'Of course that it is organic is a massive plus.', 'Juice makes so many interesting products!', 'I have tried Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser.', 'This product lathers well and rinses clean; I like the feel on my skin.', \"The scent is not typical, but it doesn't bother me.\", 'It takes a very small amount to wash my face,

benefit or change at all after using it twice a day for a week.\", 'Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer - I have very dry skin and this moisturizer was actually too heavy and uncomfortable for me, which is rare.', 'If you have extremely dry skin you may like this, but it was too waxy-feeling for me.', \"Unfortunately, the clincher here was the super strong smell, and no it doesn't smell fresh like apples, it smells almost like sour apple, and not in a good way.\", 'Green Apple SPF 15 Moisturizer - this had the same awful smell that the regular moisturizer had.', \"This was very waxy, didn't absorb well, and had the same heavy white coloring to it that regular sunscreen has and didn't absorb well.\", 'Stayed very waxy all day.', 'Green Apple Full Strength Peel - this is second of two

moisturizers had.\", 'Peel is a bit of a misnomer since this is a rinse off product.', \"I didn't notice a difference in my skin when I used this, but perhaps if it was used for more weeks than just two, there may have been some benefit.\", 'So, even though the cleanser and the peel where fairly nice, not great, the moisturizers were the clincher for me.', 'The unpleasant scent was too unpleasant to keep using them.', \"I like these products, but don't know that I'd go to the expense of buying them all in full-size versions.\", 'I feel like there are products out there that might be cheaper and work just as well.', 'Still, these do smell great and I do like that they are organic.', 'I was extremely excited to try this product line.', 'Like previous reviews my products came more than half

from company so you have better (any) support for issues?Too harsh, it was awful for my skin.', 'If you have sensitive skin this is not for you.', 'I contacted Juice Beauty about an exchange and the customer service was terrible.', 'I received this yesterday.', 'The pads are missing and the package was crushed.', \"So far I'm not too impressed with the line either.\", 'The smell is not great.',

the bottle resulting in wasted product.', 'LOVE!First of all the smell is rank.', \"It's like plastic and bug spray.\", 'There were no pads with this set.', 'The original peel set my face on fire.', 'It burned horribly and everywhere it touched was fire engine red for hours.', \"The moisturizers and the eye cream seem to sit on the surface of my skin and don't absorb quickly.\", 'Last the serum is sticky.', \"Just glad I didn't buy full sizes.\", \"Loved all items except I just realized I didn't receive brightening pads.\", 'Love this product.', 'Will definitely be ordering again.', 'I have been using the product for three weeks and it is lightening my dark spots on my face.', 'The apple smell is a little strong so I stopped using it under my nose.', 'I like the entire package, but the pump in the serum bottle is broken.', 'I can only use by pouring (wasteful) or applying with end of the pump (allowing for contamination/germs).', 'Can this item be replaced?']\n"
