       "   'review_text': \"In case anyone is wondering, the big deal about mineral oil or paraffin is that it's a by-product of petroleum. Yes, mineral oil is pure and odorless but it comes from petroleum/crude oil which is a fossil fuel that has to be drilled out of the earth. It is used to make gasoline, kerosene, asphalt and plastics. If you care about the environment, there are many viable plant-based alternatives to petroleum-based products.\\n\\nPeople often notice that their skin might feel softer and more moisturized after using a product containing mineral oil or petrolatum but what these ingredients do is create a protective layer which helps trap our skin's own oils and moisture but in the end depletes our skin of its own moisture. That's why we become addicted to lip balm when it contains petrolatum. Mineral oil is also known to clog pores.\\n\\nWith so many natural alternatives, why Eve Lom would choose to use such a cheap and questionable ingredient is beyond me. I mean, they used lots of lovely botanical essential oils in the formula but then they go and use mineral oil and not to mention all those parabens.…read more\",\n",

Since I research before purchasing, I have more hits than miss.\\nGoing against all the info ( and my better judgement) that I gathered about this product, decided to buy it either way. Like 6 months ago.\\nWhat I found was that this product was just overpriced and not as miraculous as they make us believe. Sill,I got it. The biggest jar. So, after half of a year of using it, here are my thoughts.\\nThis is a cleansing balm, that takes away all your make up, deep cleansing or micro exfoliating your skin. Those are the claims. Supposedly, if you use it, you are not going to need no toner, nor further Moisturization. Though it contains mineral oils, supposedly the ones contained in this product are of better quality and more refined.\\nSmells a lot like spa. Indeed the spicy scent is quite predominant, but that doesn't bother me at all.\\nYou are supposed to rub it all over your face, and then use the muslin clothes included, damped in as hot water as you can tolerate. Place the hot cloth over your face...breath in the scents and let the hot water 'open' your pores. Then you remove your make up using the cloth, to finally damp it on cold water to close your pores. Also, you are supposed to perform a lymphatic massage with this product a couple times a week. Comes with a little brochure with instructions.\\nFirst of all, your pores are not like doors. They don't open and then close. So that part is just ridiculous.\\nIt does the job, removes my make up, even the water resistant one, quite nicely. The mineral oil doesn't bother my skin at all. The scent is interesting and I kinda like it. The instructions for the massage are just useless. Impossible to understand, so I don't do that...also I am lazy.\\nAfter cleansing my face I don't use toner at all, but definitely I moisturize. No way I could skip that.\\nAll in all, is a good cleansing balm. Would I repurchase it? Absolutely no. The price is absurd and there are so many beautiful oils to remove your make up that are way less gimmicky than this one.\\nI didn't wrote a review of this product before cause I don't love it, nor hate it... But feel like I should review it for all of you wanting to know further of this thing.…read more\",\n",

I love the smell (clove, spicy and fragrant) and the deep massage ritual, as well as the smart little square of muslin cloth which cleanses well and exfoliates your skin beautifully. However, this cleanser contains Lanolin, a highly comedogenic ingredient. I had hoped it wouldn't cause problems for me, but against common sense, I purchased this cleanser and experienced a very unusual breakout along the jawline and nose within 6 days of nightly use. I know my skin well and this never happens unless I've introduced an irritant to my skincare.\\n\\nPros: Aesthetically pleasant, useful muslin cloth.\\nCons: Caused bad, atypical acne due to lanolin and other irritating ingredients.\\n\\nI have had great success with a sample of the TATCHA Cleansing Oil and highly recommend that product for those of you looking for an oil-based cleanser that will not cause you breakouts. This Eve Lom works for some people, but it was a very problematic product for me due to Lanolin and other irritants, and I suspect for anyone with sensitive or acne-prone skin.…read more\",\n",

I have dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin. Noteworthy things that bothered me during time of use were the scent (smells very potent & plant-like) and the fact that the very few times I would use a toner after using the cleanser, makeup residue was on the cotton pad...making me suspicious if this cleanser was doing all it claimed, let alone even removing my makeup. During the months I used this, I didn't get a ton of acne or anything, but felt my skin was very stagnant. I had tiny white bumps (closed comodones) all around my chin/mouth area and towards the end extending toward my upper lip area and inner cheeks. They weren't horribly noticeable but still very bothersome. They never went away despite all efforts (benzoyl peroxide, sal acid, etc) while using this cleanser. My facial redness was not exacerbated while using this but def not diminished, either. Again, my skin seemed stagnant. Fast fwd to now when I decided to abruptly start using my Clarisonic again with my old cleanser of choice, Philosophy, and bought Benefit Total Moisture Facial Cream to try. Also started using an exfoliator (Kate Somerville ExfoliKate). One week later my skin was FLAWLESS and glowing. The under-the-skin bumps disappeared (what?! I had even gone to the derm to get rid of them!), redness disappeared (crazy for me), I had no blemishes, no dryness, nothing. More even tone, too! I am now seriously annoyed I spent time and money on the Eve Lom line when I already had almost everything I needed for my skin to be perfect. Thank God I switched back / found this new regimen 2 months before my wedding - just enough time. Save your money and your skin and don't bother!

Sunday Riley's cleansing balm is really quite lovely - the smell and texture are really luxurious, but I found that it didn't do that good a job at taking my waterproof mascara off. I appreciated that Clinique's was unscented, but I found it's texture too oily and didn't think it cleansed my face all that well. While I'm not exactly crazy about Eve Lom's smell, I don't find it offensive and, more importantly, it does a fantastic job at melting away my makeup, especially my waterproof mascara. Since I wear makeup about 4-5 times a week, my 1.6 oz jar has lasted me almost a full four months (and I've decanted a good bit into a small jar for travel). I don't always do every single step that Eve Lom recommends (using the muslin cloth that's provided to steam my face, etc), but I find that massaging the balm into my skin and them gently washing it off with warm water does the job. Like many people, I use this cleansing balm as a first cleanse and follow up with another cleanser, usually Drunk Elephant's Peeke Bar. Though this cleansing balm is not cheap, my sensitive skin reacts really well to it and it takes off my makeup exceptionally well.…read more\",\n",

I cannot tell you how many expensive and prestige brand facial products I have used in the past 8 years (I'm in my mid 30s now) and this takes the cake. At first I thought maybe I had made a mistake when I opened the jar because the color is kind of off putting and I didn't like the smell (I still don't) but smells are subjective and shouldn't necessarily be a factor in negative feedback. But after using this balm (it's really more of a balm texture than a traditional cleanser) I must say that it's the only thing that's ever made my skin feel so nice and I have truly noticed a difference in its brightness. I have been using it for 4 months and even the slight redness I have on my cheeks has been lessened. I really don't know how else to describe it other than to say this is the only face product I have used where I do see a difference in the overall appearance of my face. I now only use Eve Lom. I use this at night and the Morning Time cleanser in the am. I use the Eve Lom moisturizer as well.

My skin felt firmer, my pores looked smaller, the tiny bit of acne on my forehead was fading away.

Initially I thought I wouldn’t be able to get over the smell, but after a few attempts, I have overcome it :) If added fragrance is what it takes to get this product sans scent, I prefer it be left as is: natural. \\n\\nI’ve been using the Shu Uemura cleaning oil prior for roughly 10 years prior to picking up this Eve Lom product.

I have combination skin that's more oily but also gets dehydrated extremely easily, so the problem for me is that I either over clean it and get it all dry, or keep it moist but start to have clogged pores from not cleaning thoroughly...BUT, I have not had such an issue since using this product.\\nHere is my routine: 1. I use a cotton pad with cleansing oil to wipe my makeup off. 2. Apply Eve Lom cleanser all over WITHOUT washing off the cleansing oil I applied in the last step. Massage with my finger tips for like a minute, and then wet the muslim cloth with warm water, and place the cloth on my face until it cools, and do the cloth thing for three times. 3. Rinse the cloth with cooler water and use it to gently wipe the face, then lastly rinse the face with flowing water. And the result is AMAZING. My skin gets refreshed and repolished every night. The texture is so soft and supple; my pores are starting to shrink and fewer blemishes. I just love it. The result is even greater if I leave the Eve Lom moisturizing mask on over night. Gorgeous results!!…read more\",\n",

When I first opened it and applied on my skin, the smell was sooooo bad that I was going to return this no matter what. However, I still went through the entire cleansing process. Oh my goodness, it is worth every penny. As much as I dislike the smell, I cannot stop using it ever since seeing what it does to my skin. It actually soothes my skin when I am breaking out and thoroughly cleanses. It was beyond my expectation. Before trying this, I have been using Clinique's cleansing balm and was in love with it, but this new cleanser is the best. I can give up on my nose for few minutes because I love what it does to my skin so much. This product is very pricey, so I only use it when I want to give myself a special treatment and will definitely repurchase when I run out.…read more\",\n",
